# How to: View the Event Subscriptions
You can view information about all the subscribers to events in an application from **Event Subscriptions** page. You can open this page directly from the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_short](includes/nav_dev_short_md.md)] or from the **Session List** page in the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] client  

### To view the event subscription from the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_short](includes/nav_dev_short_md.md)]  

-   On the **Tools** menu, choose **Debugger**, and then choose **Event Subscriptions**.  

### To view the event subscription from a [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] client  

1.  Start the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] client.  

2.  In the **Search** box, enter **Sessions**, and then choose the related link.  

3.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Events** group, choose **Subscriptions**.  

 The **9510 Event Subscriptions** page lists the event subscribers in the application. For information about the fields for each entry, see [Event Subscriptions](uiref/-$-N_9510-Event-Subscriptions-$-.md)
