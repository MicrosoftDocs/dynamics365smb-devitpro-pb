# Code Coverage Virtual Table
The Code Coverage virtual table \(ID 2000000049\) contains data about automated test execution and the extent to which application code is covered by test.  
  
 Code coverage is the means of being able to track which part of the application code has been exercised during test activity. In [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)], code coverage is recorded by C/AL code line and specifies if a code line was exercised by test and the number of times the line of code was recorded.
