# How to: Delete Databases
Typically, you take as many precautions as possible to avoid deleting a database, because to do so would usually be a big mistake. But if you really need to delete a database, you can.  
  
 You will need this function only in very special circumstances, because when you delete a database, all of the companies, reports, and so on, that are stored in it are deleted as well. If you do choose the function unintentionally, you will get a chance to cancel it before any damage is done, because the database will not be deleted until you have confirmed that you really want to delete it.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You cannot alter a database by using the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_short](includes/nav_dev_short_md.md)] if it the database deployed on Azure SQL Database.  
  
### To delete the current database  
  
-   In the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_short](includes/nav_dev_short_md.md)], on the **File** menu, choose **Database**, and then choose **Delete**.
