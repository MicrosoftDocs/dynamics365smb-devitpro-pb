# Deployment
The topics in the Deployment node are intended to help an administrator install and configure [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] software.  

## Key Features of Setup  
 With [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] Setup, you can:  

-   Install different components on different computers.  

-   Choose from a selection of predefined [Installation Options](Installation-Options.md) or create your own custom list of components and options to install. For more information, see [How to: Choose Components to Install](How-to--Choose-Components-to-Install.md).  

-   Preconfigure components before installation. For more information, see [How to: Preconfigure Components](How-to--Preconfigure-Components.md).  

-   Create, save, or load Setup configuration files that capture your selection of components and configuration information. For more information, see [How to: Create or Load a Setup Configuration File](How-to--Create-or-Load-a-Setup-Configuration-File.md).  

 You use Setup to install software and to create custom deployments that you can distribute to different users across a company.  

## Installation Notes  

-   Before installing [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] components on a computer, you must remove \(uninstall\) any previous versions.  

-   All RoleTailored components must be from the same version and build of [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] for the software to run correctly.  

-   If you have either SQL Server 2000 or Microsoft SQL Server Desktop Engine \(MSDE\) installed on a computer where you want to install [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)], then you must remove it before you begin installing. The presence of either of these database products causes a Setup error.
