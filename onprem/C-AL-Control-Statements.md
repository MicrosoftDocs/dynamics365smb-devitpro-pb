# C/AL Control Statements
All the C/AL programs that you create consist of one or more statements, which are executed sequentially in top-down order. However, you will often need to control the direct top-down flow of the execution. One or more statements may have to be repeated more than once, or you may have to make the execution of a certain statement conditional. To do this, you use control structures.  
  
 The control structures in C/AL are divided into the following main groups:  
  
-   [C/AL Compound Statements](C-AL-Compound-Statements.md)  
  
-   [C/AL Conditional Statements](C-AL-Conditional-Statements.md)  
  
-   [C/AL Repetitive Statements](C-AL-Repetitive-Statements.md)
