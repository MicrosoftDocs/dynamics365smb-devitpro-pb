# Properties of the Demo License
The demo license is automatically installed when you install the Demo Option. The demo license works with the [!INCLUDE[demolong](includes/demolong_md.md)], has serial number 000, and includes granule 540. The license allows access to the entire base application and limited access to the development system.  
  
## Properties of the Demo License  
 When the demo license is installed, you can:  
  
-   Start up to two simultaneous client sessions on any platform.  
  
-   Create up to two companies.  
  
-   Support an unlimited number of web users.  
  
-   Run in any supported language.  
  
-   Use all application functionality, including add-on products, local extensions and customizations in current and previous versions. This means that you can run, but not modify, all object types within the range 1 to 99,999,999.  
  
-   Run and modify table 18, pages 21 and 22, report 101, and XMLports 99,008,503 and 99,008,510.  
  
-   Run, modify, and create fields 99,990 to 99,999, page 99,999, report 99,999, and MenuSuite 90.  
  
## Limitations of the Demo License  
 The demo license does not allow you to:  
  
-   Import objects in text format, except for page and report ID 99,999.  
  
-   Enter dates in months other than November, December, January, and February.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  The demo license can only be used with demonstration companies such as [!INCLUDE[demoname](includes/demoname_md.md)].  
  
## Country/Region Versions  
 When you run a country/region version of [!INCLUDE[nav_current_short](includes/nav_current_short_md.md)], the license must correspond with the country/region version that you have installed.  
  
 Any license can be available in different country/region versions.
