# Development in Microsoft Dynamics NAV 
Before you begin developing code for [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)], you should consider the following:  

-   How to start learning about C/AL.  

-   How to build on your C/AL knowledge.  

-   How to build an application by using your knowledge of C/AL.  

-   What the differences are between developing applications that run on different clients.  

-   What the differences are between developing in [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] and earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)].  

-   How to upload and download files between the server and the client.  

> [!NOTE]
> To develop extensions for [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md.md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] you use the AL language. For more information, see [Getting Started with AL](developer/devenv-get-started.md).
