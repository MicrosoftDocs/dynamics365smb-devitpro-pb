# How to: Export Your Solution to a Database Backup File
If you are deploying your own [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] application on Microsoft Azure instead of [!INCLUDE[demoname](includes/demoname_md.md)], then you must create a backup of your application database before you start to deploy [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)].  

### To create a backup of the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] database  

1.  Create a backup of the SQL database for the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] application.  

     For more information, see [Create a Full Database Backup \(SQL Server\)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=296465).  

2.  Copy the backup file to the computer that you will use to provision [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] on Azure.
