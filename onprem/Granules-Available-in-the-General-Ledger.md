# Granules Available in the General Ledger
This topic contains a list of granules that are available in the General Ledger. The information in the table below does not necessarily correspond with the granule definition that is currently enforced by [!INCLUDE[nav_current_short](includes/nav_current_short_md.md)].  
  
 Each of the other functional areas can be similarly broken down into areas of more specific functionality. This means that your license file and the way that it is configured have an important influence on the functionality that is available to you in [!INCLUDE[nav_current_short](includes/nav_current_short_md.md)]. Your license file and the granules that it contains determine which functional areas you have access to and which functions you can perform in these areas. The advantage of this system is that the customer does not pay for a general license to run the product but only pays for the granules that they need to run their business.  
  
## Granules Available in the General Ledger  
 The following table lists the granules that are available in the General Ledger.  
  
|Granule name and number|Description|  
|-----------------------------|-----------------|  
|Basic General Ledger \(3,010\)|You use this granule to set up a company and post to the general ledger.<br /><br /> This granule provides you with the basic features necessary for setting up a company and posting to the general ledger, chart of accounts, general journals, VAT facilities, recurring journals, and source codes. It also includes features for internal and external reporting.<br /><br /> This granule allows you to post and report in the company's base currency. If you also purchase the Multiple Currencies granule, you can post and report in an additional currency.<br /><br /> This granule allows you to use two languages—the U.S. English language and the native language for the particular country/region.<br /><br /> This granule must always be included as part of the initial purchase of [!INCLUDE[nav_current_short](includes/nav_current_short_md.md)] because it includes one session and the first company.<br /><br /> Requirements: [!INCLUDE[nav_current_short](includes/nav_current_short_md.md)] Version 3.XX|  
|Budgets \(3,030\)|This granule allows you to work with budgets in general ledger accounts.<br /><br /> After you have created a budget, you can print a balance compared to the budget, which shows variances by percentages. Budgets are normally entered per period for the relevant general ledger accounts. You can create, copy, and work with any number of budgets at the same time. You can work with, for example, a 100% budget, a 110% budget, and so on.<br /><br /> Requirements: Basic General Ledger|  
|Account Schedules \(3,040\)|You use this granule for financial reporting. You can arrange reports based on the figures in the chart of accounts and budgets, but with a different arrangement for financial figures, text, or details than in the chart of accounts. The Account Schedules granule is like a filter for the chart of accounts that enables you to choose the accounts that you want to include. You can also use it to change the order of the accounts or combine the figures in various ways, and set up which columns to print. In addition, it is possible to make simple calculations.<br /><br /> Requirements: Basic General Ledger|  
|Consolidation \(3,050\)|This granule enables you to consolidate companies in [!INCLUDE[nav_current_short](includes/nav_current_short_md.md)].<br /><br /> The companies can come from one or from several different [!INCLUDE[nav_current_short](includes/nav_current_short_md.md)] databases or from another type of file. You can import and export financial information in this granule. If the data is retrieved from several [!INCLUDE[nav_current_short](includes/nav_current_short_md.md)] solutions, the granule is only used in the parent company itself.<br /><br /> Requirements: Basic General Ledger|  
|Allocations \(3,020\)|This granule allows you to allocate general ledger entries so you can have combinations of accounts, departments, and projects using allocation keys.<br /><br /> The allocation keys can be based on amount, percentage, or quantity.<br /><br /> Allocations can be used for many purposes, for example, to allocate overhead, such as rent, to company profit centers.<br /><br /> Requirements: Basic General Ledger|  
|Responsibility Centers \(3,060\)|With this granule you can setup profit centers and cost centers. A company can sell items with specific prices and related to a responsibility center. This granule enables you to associate a user to a responsibility center so that only sales and purchase documents related to the particular user are displayed. In addition, users get assistance when entering extra data, such as dimensions and location codes.<br /><br /> Requirements: Multiple Locations|  
|Basic XBRL \(3,070\)|With this granule you can export documents from [!INCLUDE[nav_current_short](includes/nav_current_short_md.md)] in XBRL format and import XBRL taxonomies into [!INCLUDE[nav_current_short](includes/nav_current_short_md.md)] from the Internet, e-mail, or from other systems. XBRL is an XML-based specification that uses accepted financial reporting standards based on standardized, underlying data tags. It is possible to map your general ledger to XBRL taxonomies, meaning that the same XBRL instance document can be used for various purposes, independent of the format required by the receiver of the document.<br /><br /> Requirements: Basic General Ledger|  
|Change Log \(3,080\)|This granule enables you to log user changes made to [!INCLUDE[nav_current_short](includes/nav_current_short_md.md)] master data.<br /><br /> It is possible to log all direct modifications that a user makes to the data in the database, except changes to 'working documents' such as journals, sales orders, and purchase orders. The change log functionality makes it possible to get a chronological list of all changes to any field in any table and to see who \(what user ID\) made the changes.<br /><br /> Requirements: Basic General Ledger|
