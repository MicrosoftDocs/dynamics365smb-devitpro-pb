# Customizing Dynamics 365 for Sales and Dynamics NAV Integration
If you have a customer relationship solution that is based on [!INCLUDE[crm](includes/crm_md.md)], then you can integrate it with [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)]. This enables you to integrate and synchronize data in [!INCLUDE[crm](includes/crm_md.md)] entities such as accounts, contacts, and products, with equivalent record types in [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] such as customers, contacts, and items, respectively.  

 [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] has a default integration setup that you can install and enable. The default integration setup integrates several [!INCLUDE[crm](includes/crm_md.md)] entities with [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] out-of-the-box. The default integration setup includes several objects in the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] database that are used to support the integration. After you install the default integration setup, you can modify these objects to expand the integration to additional [!INCLUDE[crm](includes/crm_md.md)] entities and corresponding [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] record types.  

 Use the following table to understand and get started with customizing your [!INCLUDE[crm](includes/crm_md.md)] integration.
