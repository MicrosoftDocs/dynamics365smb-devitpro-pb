# Extending Microsoft Dynamics NAV Using Control Add-ins
You can use client control add-ins to add custom functionality to [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Role Centers and pages. The extensibility framework has changed with [!INCLUDE[navsicily](includes/navsicily_md.md)] and it is now possible to develop control add-ins that can be used on any display target.  
  
 Add-ins that are developed with [!INCLUDE[nav7long](includes/nav7long_md.md)] are still supported and displayed on a [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] only. Using that framework you can continue to write add-ins for the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)]. Using the new framework in [!INCLUDE[navsicily](includes/navsicily_md.md)], you can write add-ins that can be run from any client.
