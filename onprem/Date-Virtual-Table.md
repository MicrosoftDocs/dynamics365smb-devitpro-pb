# Date Virtual Table
The **Date** virtual table gives you easy access to days, weeks, months, quarters, and years. The **Date** virtual table has the following fields.  
  
|Field|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|**Period Type**|Days, weeks, months, quarters, or years.|  
|**Period Start**|The date of the first day in the period.|  
|**Period End**|The date of the last day in the period.|  
|**Period No.**|The number of the period.|  
|**Period Name**|The name of the period.|  
  
 For each period type, there are many records in the **Date** table.  
  
 You can apply filters to the **Period Type**, **Period Start**, and **Period End** fields to easily get a subset or range of days, weeks, months, quarters, or years to use in your pages or reports.  
  
 The date virtual table is most frequently used to provide a range of dates; the Receivables- Payables page is a typical example.  
  
 You must create a tabular-type page to access the **Date** virtual table. For more information, see [How to: Create a Page to View a Virtual Table](How-to--Create-a-Page-to-View-a-Virtual-Table.md).
