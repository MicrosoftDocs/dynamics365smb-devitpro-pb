# Creating a Table Relationship
Table relationships are defined using the [TableRelation Property](TableRelation-Property.md). This property allows you to define both simple and advanced table relationships. A typical simple table relationship consists of a table name and an optional field name. An advanced table relationship might additionally contain conditions and filters.  
  
### To create a table relationship  
  
1.  Open Object Designer and choose **Table** to see a list of the tables.  
  
2.  Select a table and then choose **Design**.  
  
     The table opens in **Table Designer**.  
  
3.  Select the field for which you want to create a relationship and view the **Properties** window.  
  
4.  Set the **TableRelation** property value by using the following steps:  
  
    1.  In the **TableRelation** property value, choose the **AssistEdit** button.  
  
         The **Table Relation** window opens.  
  
    2.  Choose the **AssistEdit** in the **Table** cell, select a table, and then choose **OK**.  
  
    3.  Choose the **AssistEdit** in the **Field** cell, select a field, and then choose **OK**.  
  
    4.  Set the **Condition** or **Filter** fields, as needed.  
  
    5.  Choose **OK**.
