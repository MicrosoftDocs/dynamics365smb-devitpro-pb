# Install Demo or Choose an Installation Option
After you accept the software license terms and choose **Next**, you come to the **Microsoft Dynamics NAV Setup** page. This page presents the following options:  
  
-   **Install Demo**  
  
     When you choose this option, Setup immediately begins copying files. After this, you have no further interaction with Setup except to choose **Close** to exit Setup after it is finished copying files.  
  
     The Demo Install is intended for users who want to try out the features of [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)]. It is not intended as the foundation for a production environment.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  Because [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] requires a 64-bit Windows operating system, you can only install the Demo version of [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] on a computer running a 64-bit Windows operating system.  
  
-   **Choose an Installation Option**  
  
     When you choose this option, Setup moves to the **Choose an Installation Option** page, where you select from a set of predefined installation configurations.
