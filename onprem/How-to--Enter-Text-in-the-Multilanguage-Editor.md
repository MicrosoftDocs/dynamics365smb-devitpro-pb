# How to: Enter Text in the Multilanguage Editor
When you enter captions or text constants for a multilanguage-enabled application, you use the Multilanguage Editor to enter text for multiple languages.  
  
### To Enter Text in the Multilanguage Editor  
  
1.  In the Multilanguage Editor, in the **Language** field, choose the up arrow.  
  
2.  In the **Windows Language List** window, select the language that you want to add from the list, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  In the Multilanguage Editor, instead of choosing the **AssistEdit** button, you can also enter the three-letter code for the language that you want to add and then move the cursor to the **Value** field. The three-letter code is automatically replaced with the full language description.  
  
3.  In the Multilanguage Editor, in the **Value** field, enter the text in the language that you entered in the **Language** field, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
4.  \(optional\) Add a comment by doing the following:  
  
    1.  On a blank line in the Multilanguage Editor, in the **Language** field, choose the up arrow.  
  
    2.  In the **Windows Language List** window, select **Comment**, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
    3.  In the Multilanguage Editor, in the **Value** field of the Comment line, enter your comment.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  A comment is useful to provide help or instructions for a translator.
