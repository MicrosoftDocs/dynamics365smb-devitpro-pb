# Changing the Language in Dynamics NAV User Interface 
You can change the language that is used for captions in windows, on command buttons, and in other UI elements from both the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)].  
  
### To change the language from the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_short](includes/nav_dev_short_md.md)]  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_short](includes/nav_dev_short_md.md)], on the **Tools** menu, choose **Language**.  
  
2.  In the **Application Languages** window, select the language, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
### To change the language from the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)]  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)], in the app menu choose **Select Language**.  
  
2.  In the **Select Language** page, select the language, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you personalize a component such as a FactBox and then select a different language, then the personalized element is displayed in the original language. To view the elements in the new language, restore the default settings and reapply the personalization settings.  
  
### To change the language from the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)]  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)], in the app bar upper right corner, choose the user name, and then choose **My Settings**.  
  
2.  In the **My Settings** page, select the language, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  This applies to the [!INCLUDE[nav_tablet](includes/nav_tablet_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_phone](includes/nav_phone_md.md)] also.  
    >   
    >  Regional settings follow the selected language.
