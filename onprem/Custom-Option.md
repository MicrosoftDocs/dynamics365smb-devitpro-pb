# Custom Option
The Custom option is available on the **Choose an installation option** page in [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] Setup.  
  
## Installed Components  
 The Custom option offers the full list of [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] components from which you can select individual components to install. In this way, it differs from the other installation options that are available on the **Choose an installation option** page, which are subsets of available components for a particular type of user or configuration. For more information, see [How to: Choose Components to Install](How-to--Choose-Components-to-Install.md). You can use this list to design your own installation option.
