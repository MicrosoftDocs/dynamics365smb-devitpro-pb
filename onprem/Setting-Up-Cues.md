# Setting Up Cues
A Cue is a tile on a page in the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] client that provides a visual representation of aggregated business data, such as the number of open sales invoices or the total sales for the month. Cues are designed to give users with a quick status of their daily activities, which acts as a prompt them to take action. You typically add Cues on Role Center pages so that they are readily available to users.  
  
 The following figure illustrates a couple of the Cues that are available on Order Processor Role Center in the [!INCLUDE[demolong](includes/demolong_md.md)].
