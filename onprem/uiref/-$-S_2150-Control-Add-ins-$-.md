# Control Add-ins
Contains control add-ins that have been registered.  

 To register an add-in, you include it on the **Control Add-ins** page in [!INCLUDE[navnow](../includes/navnow_md.md)]. A *control add-in* is a Microsoft .NET Framework assembly that enables you to add custom functionality to the [!INCLUDE[navnow](../includes/navnow_md.md)] clients. After you have registered a control add-in, you can use it on [!INCLUDE[navnow](../includes/navnow_md.md)] pages. You select the control add-in from this window and add it to a field control on the page.
