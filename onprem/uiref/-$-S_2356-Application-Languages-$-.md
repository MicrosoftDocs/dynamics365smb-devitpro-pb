# Application Languages
Lists the languages that are included in your license and installed on your computer.  

 To open this window, on the **Tools** menu, choose **Language**.  

 The languages are used for captions in windows, on command buttons, and in other user interface \(UI\) elements. You can change the language from both the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](../includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](../includes/nav_windows_md.md)]. For more information about how to change a language, see [How to: Change the Language in the User Interface](../How-to--Change-the-Language-in-the-User-Interface.md).
