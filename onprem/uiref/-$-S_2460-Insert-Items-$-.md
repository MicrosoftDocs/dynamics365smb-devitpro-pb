# Insert Items
Inserts a menu item into a department menu. You can insert a menu item that is already created in Navigation Pane Designer. When you insert a menu item, you select the menu item from a list of menu items that are located in other departments or group folders. The **Insert Items** window lists all menu items that you can insert. The menu items are listed by the department where they were created and then alphabetically by menu item name.  

 To open this window, open Navigation Pane Designer, and then choose a department. In the department menus, right-click a folder, and then choose **Insert Item**. For more information about how to open Navigation Pane Designer, see [Navigation Pane Designer](-$-S_2401-Navigation-Pane-Designer-$-.md).
