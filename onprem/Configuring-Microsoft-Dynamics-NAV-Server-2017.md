# Configuring Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[nav2017](includes/nav2017.md)]. [See [!INCLUDE[nav2018_md](includes/nav2018_md.md)] version](Configuring-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server.md).

When you run [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] Setup and install [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)], you can provide configuration information that is then used as the configuration for the default [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance.  

 After you install [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)], you can change any of the settings that you provided during Setup, or any of the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] settings, using either the [!INCLUDE[nav_admin](includes/nav_admin_md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Windows PowerShell cmdlets for [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)].  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Each [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance has its own settings.  

## Configuring [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] in Setup  
 You can configure the default instance of [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] when running [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] Setup. You must first select [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] as a component to install. To do this, select one of the following [Installation Options](Installation-Options.md) that includes [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)]:  

-   [Server Option](Server-Option.md)  

-   [Developer Option](Developer-Option.md)  

 You can also customize your installation and the list of components to install. For more information, see [How to: Choose Components to Install](How-to--Choose-Components-to-Install.md).  

 After you specify an installation option or customize your component list, the **Specify parameters** pane is displayed in Setup. The list of parameters that you see in the **Specify parameters** pane depends on which components you have selected for configuration. Setup provides a short description for each parameter. For a description of the most important parameters for [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)], see [Server Option](Server-Option.md).  

 When you have finished entering values, choose the **Apply** button. This returns you to the **Specify parameters** page in Setup.  

 After you finish running Setup, you can modify [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] using any of the methods described in the following section.  

## Configuring [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] After Installation  
 After you install [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)], you can change any of the settings that you provided during Setup, or any of the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] settings, in any of the following ways:  

-   Using the [!INCLUDE[nav_admin](includes/nav_admin_md.md)]. For more information, see [Settings in the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Administration Console](Configuring-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server.md#NavAdminSettings) and [Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server Administration Tool](Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server-Administration-Tool.md).  

-   Using the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] PowerShell cmdlets that are available in the [!INCLUDE[nav_shell](includes/nav_shell_md.md)]. For more information, see [Using Microsoft Dynamics NAV Administration Shell Cmdlets to Modify Settings](Configuring-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server.md#UsingPowerShell).  

-   By directly editing CustomSettings.config, the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] configuration file. By default, this file is located in [!INCLUDE[navnow_install](includes/navnow_install_md.md)]\\Service\\Instances\\\<instancename\>. We recommend that you do not directly edit the configuration file, because if you make any errors in typing, then you may not be able to start the instance.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  After you modify a [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] setting, you must restart the associated [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance before any changes can take effect.  

##  <a name="NavAdminSettings"></a> Settings in the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Administration Console  
 In the tables in the following sections, [!INCLUDE[nav_admin](includes/nav_admin_md.md)] setting names are used. Settings names in the CustomSettings.config file are slightly different. Quotation marks are required for all values.

> [!NOTE]  
>  You must choose **Edit** in the [!INCLUDE[nav_admin](includes/nav_admin_md.md)] before you can modify any values.  

###  <a name="General"></a> General Tab Settings  
 The following table describes fields on the **General** tab in the [!INCLUDE[nav_admin](includes/nav_admin_md.md)].  

|Setting|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|  
|-------------|---------------------------------------|
|Build Restriction|Specifies what happens when a [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] client tries to connect to the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance when the client is running a different build version of [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] than the server instance.<br /><br /> Values:<br /><br />**AlwaysConnect**<br /><br />**WarnClient**<br /> Before connecting the client to the server instance, a message appears that informs the user that the build versions for the client and server instance are different. The user can choose to continue or cancel the connection.<br /><br /> **DoNotAllow**<br /> A message appears that informs the user that the client and server instance build versions are different, and the client does not connect to the server instance.<br /><br /> Default: WarnClient<br /><br /> **Note:** With the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_tablet](includes/nav_tablet_md.md)], this setting compares the build version of the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)] on IIS with the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance. It controls the connection between [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)] and the server instance.|  
|Certificate Thumbprint|If you use security certificates to protect communications between [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] and client services or web services over an open or wide-area network, you must provide the certificate thumbprint to [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] by updating this setting. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Implementing Security Certificates in a Test Environment](Walkthrough--Implementing-Security-Certificates-in-a-Test-Environment.md) and [How to: Implement Security Certificates in a Production Environment](How-to--Implement-Security-Certificates-in-a-Production-Environment.md).|  
|Compile and Load Business Application|Specifies whether the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance compiles all the business application assemblies and loads them to cache memory when the server instance is started. The assemblies are then retrieved from memory when requested by a [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] client.<br /><br /> Enabling this setting will reduce the time it takes for the server instance to load application objects the first time they are requested by a [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] client after the server instance started. However, it will also slightly increase the memory usage by the server instance.<br /><br />If you enable this setting, when the server instance starts for the first time, the business application assemblies will be compiled and loaded to the cache memory of the computer that is running the server instance. The assemblies, along with metadata such object timestamp information, are also stored to a temporary folder on the computer's file system. Whenever the server instance is restarted, it will compare the assemblies that are stored in memory with corresponding objects in the connected database to determine whether the assemblies in memory can be reused. An assembly will be reused if the following conditions are met:<br /><br />- The connected database is the same as before, based on the *databasemagic* field in the dbproperty table.<br /><br />- The object time stamp that is recorded on the compiled assembly matches the object timestamp in metadata of the connected database.<br /><br />If the conditions are not met for an assembly or an assembly for an object in the database is not found in the memory, then a new assembly is built and stored for reuse to cache memory and the file system of the server instance compute for reuse.<br /><br />If you disable this setting, individual assemblies will be compiled on-demand as application objects are requested by the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] client. The compiled assemblies will not be reused on subsequent server instance restarts.<br /><br />Notes:<ul><li>This setting does not apply to query objects.</li><li>Assembly compilation happens asynchronously.</li><li>On average, all application objects will be loaded within the first few minutes that the server instance operates.</li></ul>|  
|Credential Type|Specifies the authentication mechanism for [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] users of this [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance.<br /><br /> The options are **Windows**, **Username**, **NavUserPassword**, **AccessControlService**, and **None**. For more information, see [Users and Credential Types](Users-and-Credential-Types.md).<br /><br /> If you choose **AccessControlService**, you must specify a token signing key for use with Azure Access Control service \(ACS\), or a federation metadata location for use with Azure AD. If you choose **NavUserPassword**, and you specify a token signing key, you can use both NavUserPassword and AccessControlService for this server instance.<br /><br />Notes:<ul><li>**None** is for internal use on system sessions and typically should not be used. If you choose **None**, then the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance cannot start.</li><li>**ExchangeIdentity** and **TaskScheduler** are for internal use only, and should not be used.</li></ul>Default: **Windows**|
|Data Cache Size|The contextual size of the data cache.<br /><br /> Default: 9|  
|Debugging Allowed|Specifies whether C/AL debugging is allowed for this [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance.<br /><br /> Default: Enabled|  
|Default Client|Specifies the client type that is used to generate URLs when the client type is set to Default.<br /><br /> The options are **Current**, **Windows**, **Web**, **SOAP**, and **OData**.<br /><br /> Default: **Current**|  
|  Diagnostic Trace Level  |  Specifies the lowest severity level of telemetry events to be recorded in the event log for the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance. Telemetry events have IDs from  700-706. <BR /><BR />The setting has the following values, which correspond to the event severity levels (listed from highest to lowest level): **Critical**, **Error**, **Warning**, **Normal** (this corresponds to the **Information** level), and **Verbose**.<BR /><BR />You use this setting to filter out lower-level events from the log. For example, if you set this setting to **Error**, only **Error** and **Critical** events will be logged.<BR /><BR />**Note:** Events are recorded in the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] channel logs, which you can see in Event Viewer, under **Applications and Services Logs**.|  
|Enable Certificate Validation|Specifies whether validation should be performed on the security certificate.<br /><br /> Default: Enabled|  
|Enable Debugging|Specifies whether the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance starts with debugging enabled.<br /><br /> If this option is enabled, the following occurs:<br /><br /> When the client first connects, all C\# files for the application are generated. C\# files persist between [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] restarts. Application objects are compiled with debug information.<br /><br /> Default: Not enabled|  
|Enable Event Logging to Windows Application Log|Specifies whether to record admin and operational type events \(errors, warnings, and information messages\) that occur on [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instances in the **Windows Application** log on the computer that is running [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)].<br /><br /> Because [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance events are always logged to the **Application and Services Logs**, you can disable logging [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance events in the Windows Application log and not lose any data. For more information, see [Monitoring Dynamics NAV Server Events Using Event Viewer](Monitoring-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server-Events-in-the-Windows-Event-Log.md) and [How to: Disable Logging Events to the Windows Application Log](How-to--Disable-Logging-Events-to-the-Windows-Application-Log.md).<br /><br /> **Important:** If you are using System Center Operations Manager to monitor [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instances, do not disable logging to the Windows Application log. If you do, monitoring will not work.|  
|Enable File Access by C/AL Functions|Specifies whether C/AL functions of the file data type can access files on the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] computer.<br /><br /> Default: Enabled|  
|Enable Full C/AL Function Tracing|Specifies whether full C/AL function tracing is enabled on Event Tracing for Windows \(ETW\) sessions.<br /><br /> When this setting is enabled, all C/AL function calls and statements are traced.<br /><br /> When this setting is disabled, only root C/AL function calls are traced. Statements and functions that are called from a function are not traced.<br /><br /> For more information, see [Monitoring Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server Events](Monitoring-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server-Events.md).<br /><br /> Default: Not enabled|  
|  Encryption Key Provider  |  Specifies where the encryption key is that is used to encrypt data in the database, either **LocalKeyFile** or **AzureKeyVault** values. If you use **AzureKeyVault**, see the **Azure Key Vault Encryption Provider** tab settings. <BR /><BR />Default: LocalKeyFile |
|Max Concurrent Calls|The maximum number of concurrent client calls that can be active on this [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance.<br /><br /> Default: 40<br /><br /> Range: 1 - 2,147,483,647<br /><br /> You can also use **MaxValue** as a value to indicate no limit.|  
|Max Data Rows Allowed to Send to Excel|Specifies the maximum number of rows that can be included in an Excel document that is generated from data in a list type page in the client.<br /><br /> If you do not want to have a limit on rows, set the value to **MaxValue**.<br /><br /> **Note:** This setting only pertains to list type pages in the client. For other pages types, like cards, the limit on rows is configured in the client. For more information, see [Configuring the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Windows Client After Installation](Configuring-the-Windows-Client.md#afterset).|
|Maximum Stream Read Size|Specifies the maximum number of bytes that can be read from a stream (InStream object) in a single C/AL read operation, such a READ or InStream.READTEXT function call. This setting pertains to UTF-8 and UTF-16 text encoding; not MS-DOS encoding.<br /><br />Default value: 1000000.|
|Metadata Provider Cache Size|Specifies the number of objects that can be cached. Set this value to 0 to disable caching.<br /><br /> Default: 150|  
|Multitenant|Specifies if the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance can be used in a multitenant environment.<br /><br /> Tenant databases can only be mounted on the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance if this setting is selected. For more information, see [Multitenant Deployment Architecture](Multitenant-Deployment-Architecture.md).|  
|Network Protocol|Specifies the network protocol for accessing the database.<br /><br /> Valid values: Default, Named, Sockets, MultiProtocol<br /><br /> Default: Default|  
|Report PDF Font Embedding|Specifies whether fonts are embedded in PDF files that are generated for reports when the report uses an RDLC report layout at runtime. This setting applies when reports are run and saved as PDF files on the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] client \(from the report request page or print preview window\) or on [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] \(by the [SAVEAS Function](SAVEAS-Function.md) or [SAVEASPDF Function \(Report\)](SAVEASPDF-Function--Report-.md) in C/AL code\).<br /><br /> **Note:** This setting does not apply when a report uses a Word report layout at runtime.<br /><br /> Embedding fonts in a PDF of a report makes sure that the PDF will use the same fonts as the original file, regardless of where the PDF is opened and which fonts are installed on the computer. However, embedding fonts can significantly increase the size of the PDF files. By disabling font embedding, you can decrease the size of the report PDF files.<br /><br /> **Note:** This is a global setting for font embedding in report PDF files. You can override this setting on a report basis by the specifying the [PDFFontEmbedding Property](PDFFontEmbedding-Property.md).<br /><br /> Default: Not enabled|  
|Send Feedback|When this setting is enabled, the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance collects basic information about your hardware configuration and about how you use [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)], and sends it to Microsoft. Microsoft uses this information to identify trends and usage patterns and to improve its software.<br /><br /> Default: Not enabled<br /><br /> This is the **EnableSoftwareQualityMetrics** setting in the CustomSettings.config file.<br /><br /> For more information, see [Customer Experience Improvement Program and Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server](Customer-Experience-Improvement-Program-and-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server.md).|  
|Services Default Company|Specifies the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] company that the client services, OData web services, and NAS services use as the default company.<br /><br /> If your [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] database contains only one company, leave the setting blank.|  
|Services Default Time Zone|Specifies the time zone in which web service and NAS services calls are run.<br /><br /> Values:<br /><br /> **UTC**<br /> All business logic for web services and NAS services on the server instance runs in Coordinated Universal Time \(UTC\).

|Services Option Format|Specifies the source of the text strings to use for the option values of an option data type field.<br /><br /> Values:<br /><br />**OptionString**<br /> Uses the text strings that are specified by the [OptionString Property](OptionString-Property.md) of a field.<br /><br />  **OptionCaption**<br /> Uses the text strings that are specified by the [OptionCaption Property](OptionCaption-Property.md) of a field.<br /><br /> Default: OptionCaption|  
|Session Event Table Retain Period|An integer value that specifies how many months events in the Session Events table are retained.<br /><br /> Default: 3|  
|UI Elements Removal|Specifies if UI elements are removed when the related object is not accessible according to the license or according to user permissions or both. For more information, see [How to: Specify When UI Elements Are Removed](How-to--Specify-When-UI-Elements-Are-Removed.md).|  
|Use NTLM Authentication|Specifies whether NTLM authentication is enabled for web services. To require Kerberos authentication, disable this option.<br /><br /> Default: Not enabled|  

###  <a name="Database"></a> Database Tab Settings  
 The following table describes fields on the **Database** tab in the [!INCLUDE[nav_admin](includes/nav_admin_md.md)].  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance is configured as a multitenant server instance, then except for the **Database Name**, **Database Instance**, and **Database Server** settings, the settings apply to both the application database and the tenant database.  

|Setting|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|  
|-------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Close Inactive SQL Connections|Specifies when to close inactive SQL Server connections. The value specifies the age at which to close connections. While a connection is inactive, starting from zero, the age is increased by one every 30 seconds. When the age of the inactive connection reaches the specified value, the connection is closed. A value of **0** means that inactive SQL connections will not be closed.<br /><br /> Default: 10|  
|Database Instance|The name of the SQL Server database instance to connect to. If the value is a null string \(""\), [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance connects to the default database instance of SQL Server.<br /><br /> If the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance is configured as a multitenant server instance, then this setting specifies the SQL Server database instance that hosts the application database.<br /><br /> Default: NAVDEMO|

|Database Server|A valid network name for the computer that is running SQL Server.<br /><br /> If the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance is configured as multi-tenant server instance, then this setting specifies the computer that hosts the application database.<br /><br /> Default: The computer that you selected in [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Setup.|  
|Disable SmartSQL|Specifies whether the SmartSQL performance optimization feature is disabled.<br /><br />- If the check box is selected, SmartSQL is disabled.<br /><br />- If the check box is cleared, SmartSQL is enabled.<br /><br />When SmartSQL is enabled, [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] converts FIND calls and FlowField calculations into a single SQL statement. This can improve performance when running pages that contain FlowFields. However, it can be helpful to disable SmartSQL when troubleshooting database queries because statements are separated into more discrete statements. For more information, see [Troubleshooting: Long Running SQL Queries Involving FlowFields by Disabling SmartSQL](Troubleshooting-Queries-Involving-FlowFields-By-Disabling-SmartSQL.md).<br /><br /> Default: SmartSQL performance optimization is enabled \(check box is cleared\)|  
|Enable Buffered Insert|Specifies whether to buffer rows that are being inserted into a SQL Server database table.<br /><br /> When this parameter is enabled, up to 5 rows will be buffered in the table queue before they are inserted into the table.<br /><br /> To optimize performance in a production environment, you should enable this parameter. In a test environment, you can disable this parameter to help debug failures that occur when you insert rows in an SQL database table. For more information, see [Bulk Inserts](Bulk-Inserts.md).<br /><br /> Default: Enabled|  
|Enable Encryption on SQL Server Connections|Specifies whether the SQL connect string should request encryption when connecting to SQL Server services.|

### <a name="AzureAd"></a>Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Tab Settings
The following table describes fields on the **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)** tab in the [!INCLUDE[nav_admin](includes/nav_admin_md.md)].

The settings in this tab configure the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance to use Azure AD authentication. The settings are only relevant when the server instance is configured Access Control Service, that is, when the **Credential Type** is set to **AccessControlService**. For more information about authenticating using Azure AD, see [Authenticating Users with Azure Active Directory](Authenticating-Users-with-Azure-Active-Directory.md).

|  Setting  |  Description  |
|-----------|---------------|  
|  Application Client Certificate Thumbprint|  Specifies the thumbprint of the x509 certificate that is used with the Azure AD application client for authentication.<BR /><BR />A public certificate file (.cer) must be installed on the application client and associated with an Azure AD service principal.<BR /><BR />A private certificate file (.pfx) must be installed on the computer on which the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance is installed. The server instance service account must have access to the private key of that certificate.|
|  Application Client ID|  Specifies the ID of the application tenant. The ID is used when accessing data in Azure AD.<BR /><BR />The authentication token for communicating with Azure AD should be retrieved by specifying the **Application Client Certificate Thumbprint**, with a fallback to use the **Application Client Secret**. |
|  Application Client Secret|  Specifies the secret to use with **Application Client ID** for Azure AD authentication. |
|  Azure AD App ID URI |Specifies the App ID URI that is registered for [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] in the Microsoft Azure Active Directory \(Azure AD\). You use this setting to configure [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] web services for OAuth authentication, specifically when the *Credential Type* setting is **AccessControlService**.  It is used to validate the security tokens that the server instance receives in SOAP and OData calls. <br /><br /> The App ID URI is a logical identifier and does not have to represent a valid location, although it is common practice to use the physical URL of the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] web service.<br /><br /> The App ID URI is typically the same as the value of *wtrealm* parameter of the **ACSUri** setting that is included in web.config file for the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] and the ClientUserSettings.config file for the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)].<br /><br /> An example of an App ID URI is *https://localhost:7047/*.<br /><br /> For more information about how to use the Azure Active Directory App ID URI with OAuth authentication, see [Using OAuth to Authenticate Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Services \(Odata and SOAP\)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=510894).|
|  Enable Membership Entitlement|  Configures the server instance to use membership entitlement for controlling access the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)].<BR /><BR />This setting is typically only used for software as a service (SaaS) solutions.|
|  Excel add-in AAD client app ID |  This setting is used to set up the Excel Add-in that enables users to use Excel to modify and update [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] data.<br /><br />The setting specifies the client ID of the Azure AD tenant that is used for the Excel add-in. The Excel add-in requires a separate Azure AD tenant. For more information, see [Configuring Dynamics NAV and the Excel Add-In](configuring-dynamics-nav-excel-addin.md).|
|  Extended Security Token Lifetime |  Specifies the number of hours that are added to the lifetime of Azure AD security tokens, which are used to authenticate client users. When the lifetime expires, the client is disconnected from the server instance. An event with a message such as "The SAML2 token is invalid because its validity period ended." is recorded in the event log for the server instance. In general, the lifetime of security tokens is 1 hour.<BR /><BR /> The valid range of this setting is from 0 to 24 hours. The default value is 0.|
|  WS-Federation Login Endpoint  |  Specifies the URL for the federation sign-on page that [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] redirects to when configured for single sign-on.<BR /><BR />You must specify a URL in the following format:<BR /><BR /> https://login.windows.net/[AADTENANTID]/wsfed?wa=wsignin1.0%26wtrealm=...%26wreply=....<BR /><BR /> The placeholder [AADTENANTID] represents the GUID of your Azure AD tenant. If the server instance has to support multiple Azure AD tenants, then the **Azure AD Tenant ID** parameter that is specified when mounting a tenant replaces the placeholder.|
|  WS-Federation Metadata Location  |  Specifies the URL for the federation metadata document that describes the configuration information for your Azure AD tenant. The federation metadata document is used to validate the security tokens that the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_tablet](includes/nav_tablet_md.md)] receive, and to establish a trust relationship with between [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] and an application that you have added to Azure AD.<BR /><BR /> You must specify a URL in the following format:<BR /><BR />https://login.windows.net/[AADTENANTID]/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml<BR /><BR />The placeholder [AADTENANTID] represents the GUID of your Azure AD tenant. If the server instance has to support multiple Azure AD tenants, then the Azure AD Tenant ID parameter that is specified when mounting a tenant replaces the placeholder. <BR /><BR /> This parameter is relevant only when **Credential Type**, on the **General** tab, is set to **AccessControlService**. For more information, see [Authenticating Users with Azure Active Directory](Authenticating-Users-with-Azure-Active-Directory.md).|  

### Task Scheduler Tab Settings
The following table describes fields on the **Task Scheduler** tab in the [!INCLUDE[nav_admin](includes/nav_admin_md.md)].

The task scheduler processes jobs and other processes on a scheduled basis. For more information about task scheduler, see [Task Scheduler](task-scheduler.md).

|  Setting  |  Description  |
|-----------|---------------|  
|  Enable Task Scheduler  |  Specifies whether the server instance starts with the task scheduler enabled. <BR /><BR />If this option is enabled, the server instance will process scheduled tasks.<BR /><BR />Default: Enabled |
|  Maximum Concurrent Running Tasks  |  Specifies the maximum number of tasks that can run simultaneously on the server instance.<BR /><BR />The value that you specify will depend on the hardware (CPUs) of the deployment environment and what you want to prioritize: client performance or scheduled tasks (such as job queue entries). The setting is particularly relevant when the server instance is used for both scheduled tasks and client services. If there are many jobs running at the same time, you might experience that the response time for clients gets slower. In which case, you could decrease the value. However, if the value is too low, it might take longer than desired for scheduled tasks to process. When you have a dedicated server instance for scheduled tasks, this setting is less important with respect to client performance. <BR /><BR />Default: 10 |

### Reports Tab Settings
The following table describes fields on the **Reports** tab in the [!INCLUDE[nav_admin](includes/nav_admin_md.md)].

|  Setting  |  Description  |
|-----------|---------------|  
|  Enable Save as Excel on Request Pages of RDLC-layout Reports  |  Specifies whether users can open or save a report as an Microsoft Excel document if the report uses an RDLC layout.<BR /><BR />If you clear this check box, the **Excel** option is removed from the **Print** menu on the request page.<BR /><BR />Default: Enabled|
|  Enable Save as Word on Request Pages of RDLC-layout Reports  |  Specifies whether users can open or save a report as a Microsoft Word document if the report uses an RDLC layout.<BR /><BR /> If you clear this check box, the **Word** option is removed from the **Print** menu on the request page.<BR /><BR />Default: Enabled|
|  Enable Save from Report Preview  |  Specifies whether users can save a report as a PDF, Microsoft Word, or Microsoft Excel document from the report preview window.<BR /><BR />If you clear this check box, the **Save As** icon is removed from the report preview window.<BR /><BR />Default: Enabled|
| Report PDF Font Embedding  |  Specifies whether fonts are embedded in PDF files that are generated for reports when the report uses an RDLC report layout at runtime. This setting applies when reports are run and saved as PDF files on the client (from the report request page or print preview window) or on the server instance (by the [SAVEAS function](SAVEAS-Function.md) or [SAVEASPDF function](SAVEASPDF-Function--Report-.md) in C/AL code).<BR /><BR />**Note:** This setting does not apply when a report uses a Word report layout at runtime.<br/><br/>Embedding fonts in a PDF of a report makes sure that the PDF will use the same fonts as the original file, regardless of where the PDF is opened and which fonts are installed on the computer. However, embedding fonts can significantly increase the size of the PDF files. By disabling font embedding, you can decrease the size of the report PDF files.<BR /><BR />**Note:** This is a global setting for font embedding in report PDF files. You can override this setting on a report basis by the specifying the [PDFFontEmbedding property](PDFFontEmbedding-Property.md).<BR /><BR />Default: Enabled|

##  <a name="UsingPowerShell"></a> Using Microsoft Dynamics NAV Administration Shell Cmdlets to Modify Settings  
 The [!INCLUDE[nav_shell](includes/nav_shell_md.md)] includes several cmdlets that enable you to create and modify [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instances. Use the `Set-` cmdlets to modify a setting on a [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance. For example, you can change the value for `DatabaseServer` to `DatabaseServer.Domain.Com` for the server instance named `MyInstance` by executing this cmdlet:  

```  
Set-NAVServerConfiguration MyInstance -KeyName DatabaseServer -KeyValue DatabaseServer.Domain.Com  
```
