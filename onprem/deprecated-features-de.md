# Deprecated Features in the German Version of Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2018
This topic lists and describes the local functionality for Germany that has been removed from [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)], made available from a new page or report, or replaced by a new feature.

## Blanket Order Archiving and Document Line Tracking
You can archive and delete blanket sales and purchase orders. You can view documents that are related to sales order lines and purchase order lines, including from archived order lines. Related documents that you can track include quotes, shipments, receipts, and blanket orders. This helps you to identify documents used to process orders.

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced?|Why?|
|----|----|
|Moved| Blanket Order Archiving and Document Line Tracking features are no longer specific to Germany, so we have made them generally available in the standard product. |
