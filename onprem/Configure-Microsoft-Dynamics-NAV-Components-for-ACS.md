# Configure Microsoft Dynamics NAV Components for ACS

[!INCLUDE[ACS_md](includes/ACS_md.md)]

The components to configure are the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance and the client. This is either the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)].  
  
> [!WARNING]  
>  Before you configure components, you must have created at least one user who will be able to log on using ACS authentication. For more information, see [Create Microsoft Azure Access Control Service Users](Create-Microsoft-Azure-Access-Control-Service-Users.md).
