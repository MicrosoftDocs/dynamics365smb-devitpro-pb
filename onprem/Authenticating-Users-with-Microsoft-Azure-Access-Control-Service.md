# Authenticating Users with Microsoft Azure Access Control Service

[!INCLUDE[ACS_md](includes/ACS_md.md)]

Microsoft Azure Access Control service \(ACS\) is a cloud service that provides user authentication and authorization for web applications and services. By using ACS, you do not have to factor authentication and authorization into your application code. Instead of implementing an authentication system with user accounts that are specific to your application, you can let ACS orchestrate the authentication and much of the authorization of your users. ACS integrates with standards-based identity providers, including enterprise directories such as Active Directory, and web identities such as Microsoft account, Google, Yahoo\!, and Facebook.
