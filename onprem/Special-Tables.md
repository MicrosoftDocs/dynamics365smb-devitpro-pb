# Special Tables
[!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] has three types of tables that serve special purposes. The types of tables are:  

-   Temporary  

-   System  

-   Virtual  

 Temporary tables are used as a repository for temporary information at run time. System and virtual tables are system generated tables that provide information about the current state of the system.
