If the debugger is attached to a session, then you can specify that the debugger breaks before the next C/AL statement is run in that session.

### To specify a break on the next C/AL statement  
  
-   In the **Debugger** window, on the **Home** tab, in the **Running Code** group, choose **Break**.
