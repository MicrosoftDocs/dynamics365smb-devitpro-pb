# How to: Open a Card Page from an Item in a List
You can associate items in a list page with a related card page so that when a user double-clicks the list item, the card page for that item is opened. The **CardPageID** property is used to associate an item in a list with a specific card page. For example, you can use it to associate a name in a customer list the related customer card.  
  
### To associate a card page with a list page  
  
1.  With the list page open in Page Designer and with the first available empty row in Page Designer selected, on the **View** menu, choose **Properties**.  
  
     The **Properties** window opens.  
  
2.  Locate the **CardPageID** property, and then choose the **AssistButton** in the value field.  
  
     The **Page List** window opens.  
  
3.  Select a page from the list, and then choose **OK**.
