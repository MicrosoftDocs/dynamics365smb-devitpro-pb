# Managing Language, Regional Settings, and Time Zone in the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Client
This topic describes how to set the language, regional settings, and time zone for the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)].  
  
## Managing Languages  
 The [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] clients support multiple language versions of [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)]. To enable [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] in another language, you install the language module for that language. A language module contains translated text strings for the user interface, the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] database, and [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)], such as for logs and error reporting. After you install a language module, you configure the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)] to use the language.  
  
### Installing a Language Module  
 You can obtain language modules from [Language Modules for Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=317425) \(requires PartnerSource account\). After you obtain a language module, you install its components on the computers that are running the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] database.  
  
 For information about how to install a language module, see [How to: Install Language Modules](How-to--Install-Language-Modules.md).  
  
### Changing the Language, Region, and Time Zone  
 You change the language, the region, and the time zone in the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] by using the **My Settings** page located in the upper right corner under the user name that you are signed in with. The regional settings determine the format of data such as dates, times, numbers, currency, and so on. The time zone specifies the time zone that is applied to date and time data that a user views or enters in the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)]. You need to sign out and sign in again for the change to take effect.
