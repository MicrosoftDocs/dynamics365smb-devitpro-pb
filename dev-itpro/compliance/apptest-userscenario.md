# User Scenario Documentation

One of the keys to a successful extension validation is a document that guides the user through the setup and usage of the extension. We want to ensure that we are validating the functionality in the correct manner. Following are some key points to keep in mind when writing the user scenario document.

- Be as detailed as possible. No detail is too small. If a field needs a specific value, include that value in your document.
- Use screenshots as much as possible. They provide a good picture of what you want the user to accomplish.
- Provide all prerequisite and setup steps required for successful test scenario completion.
- Include the most important functionality scenarios of your extension. We are not looking to test your entire extension, but we do want to ensure we are validating the most used aspects of your app.
