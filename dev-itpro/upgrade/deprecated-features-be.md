# Deprecated Features in the Belgian Version of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central
This topic lists and describes the local functionality for Belgium that has been removed from Dynamics 365 Business Central, made available from a new page or report, or replaced by a new feature.

## Isabel integration
You can integrate with Isabel to make it easy to upload and download bank files.

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced?|Why?|
|----|----|
|Removed| This feature uses an automation that is not supported by the Dynamics 365 Business Central compiler and blocks the C/AL to AL conversion. In an earlier release we made this functionality unavailable, and now we have removed it. Microsoft partners can provide their solutions for customers who need to integrate with Isabel.
