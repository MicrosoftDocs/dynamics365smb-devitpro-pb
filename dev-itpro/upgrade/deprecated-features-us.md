# Deprecated Features in the United States Version of [!INCLUDE [prod_long](../developer/includes/prod_long.md)]
This topic lists and describes the local functionality for the United States that has been removed from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], made available from a new page or report, or replaced by a new feature.

### Bank Reconciliation Worksheet and Deposits in North American versions (US, CA, MX)
|Moved, Removed, or Replaced? |    Why?|    When?|
|-----------------------------|-----|-----|
|Replaced | We're standardizing the features for reconciling bank accounts and making cash deposits, so that more country versions can benefit from them. For more information, see [Standardizing the bank reconciliation process in North American versions](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/standardizing-bank-reconciliation-process-north-american-versions). The current features still allow you to view posted bank reconciliations done through the Bank Rec. Worksheet page, and posted deposits done through the Deposits features, but you can't use these features to create new entries. In April 2023, you must use the Bank Reconciliation page for bank reconciliations. The Bank Rec. Worksheet page won't be available.| 2022 release wave 1 |
