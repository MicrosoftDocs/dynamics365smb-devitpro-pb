# Deprecated Features in the Russian Version of [!INCLUDE [prod_long](../includes/prod_long.md)]

This article describes the features that will be or have been moved, removed, or replaced in the local functionality for Russia in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [feature-deprecation](../includes/feature-deprecation.md)]

## Changes in 2021 release wave 2

### Human Resources and Payroll module

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced?|Why?|Replacement availability|
|----|----|----|
|Removed| To help make sure that we provide the very best solutions for our customers, we will remove the Russian payroll capabilities from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] in release 2021 wave 2. Payroll is not included in the world-wide strategic focus of the Microsoft Dynamics 365 portfolio. Partners and ISVs are best positioned to provide payroll functionality that remains compliant with local regulation and tax updates. We will continue to offer mainstream support for the existing [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] payroll functionality accordingly to the [product lifecycle information](/lifecycle/products/?products=dynamics&terms=Business%20Central%20on-premises).|We recommend that our customers work with their implementation partner to determine the best local payroll solution based on their specific needs.|

## Changes before 2021 release wave 1
