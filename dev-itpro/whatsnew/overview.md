# What's new and planned in Business Central

Wondering about upcoming and recently released capabilities in Dynamics 365 Business Central? This article brings together new, changed, and planned capabilities to help you understand what's available now and plan for what's coming next.

## Released and upcoming features

Business Central follows a six‑month release cycle called a *release wave*, which groups new, changed, and planned features for a half‑year period. Details for each recent release wave are available through **Release Planner** and **Release Plans**. These sources use the same underlying data, but present it differently.

- **Release Planner**: Explore feature details, availability, and rollout progress in an interactive view where you can filter and share selections. [View the release planner](https://experience.dynamics.com/releaseplans/?app=Business+Central).
- **Release Plans**: Read about features in each release wave and optionally download a PDF. Choose a link for a release wave:

  - Current wave: [2025 release wave 2](/dynamics365/release-plan/2025wave2/smb/dynamics365-business-central/planned-features)
  - Earlier waves: [Release plans for Dynamics 365 and Power Platform](/dynamics365/release-plans/)

## New and changed features in recent minor updates

Minor updates are released monthly and can include new release wave features, regulatory updates, and critical improvements/fixes. Each update is documented in a dedicated article.

<!-- remove entries with an auto-update date older than the current month (unless the table is then pathetically short - there should always be three entries as a best practice). The links can be to articles in Docs, the planned-features article in the release plans, or KB articles with bug details. BAP Skilling does not own the individual articles with concrete information but provides tooling and guidance to help product teams, customer/partner success teams, or support teams gather relevant information.  -->

For earlier versions, visit the [Updates for earlier major versions](whatsnew-update-26-5.md) section.

## Get the latest version

New customers automatically get the latest version. If you're an existing partner or customer, check your email for update notifications. <!-- standard wording for apps with auto-update. If the app has an article with instruction for admins to apply an update, then link to that -->
