# What's new or changed in Business Central

Wondering about upcoming and recently released capabilities in Dynamics 365 Business Central? We've captured all the details, end to end, top to bottom, which you can use for planning.

## What's available and planned for release wave

Business Central follows a six-month release cycle called a *release wave*. Each wave groups new, changed, and planned features for that half-year period. Release wave details are available through two sources: Release Planner and Release Plans. These sources use the same underlying data, which is updated regularly throughout the release wave.

- **Release Planner** presents availability and rollout progress for features across all release waves. It provides an interactive experience to track where and when features become available, letting you filter on features and share them with others. [Check out the release planner site](https://experience.dynamics.com/releaseplans/?app=Business+Central).

- **Release Plans** on Microsoft Learn describe features for specific release waves. Features are organized by functiinal area, and each feature includes a business value, description, and planned public preview and general availability dates. You can also download the release plan as a single PDF. Choose the following links to learn about the latest versions of Business Central.

  - Current wave: [2025 release wave 2](/dynamics365/release-plan/2025wave2/smb/dynamics365-business-central/planned-features)
  - Previous wave: [2025 release wave 1](/dynamics365/release-plan/2025wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/planned-features)
  - Earlier waves: [Release plans for Dynamics 365 and Power Platform](/dynamics365/release-plans/).

## What's available in latest minor updates

<!-- remove entries with an auto-update date older than the current month (unless the table is then pathetically short - there should always be three entries as a best practice). The links can be to articles in Docs, the planned-features article in the release plans, or KB articles with bug details. BAP Skilling does not own the individual articles with concrete information but provides tooling and guidance to help product teams, customer/partner success teams, or support teams gather relevant information.  -->

For earlier versions, visit the [Updates for earlier major versions](whatsnew-update-16-5.md) section.

## Get the latest version

New customers automatically get the latest version. If you're an existing partner/customer, check your email for notifications about updates. <!-- standard wording for apps with auto-update. If the app has an article with instruction for admins to apply an update, then link to that -->
