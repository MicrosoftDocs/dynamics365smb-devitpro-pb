# What's new and planned in Business Central

Wondering about upcoming and recently released capabilities in Dynamics 365 Business Central? We've captured all the details, end to end, top to bottom, which you can use for planning.

## New and planned in release wave

Business Central follows a six-month release cycle called a *release wave*. Each wave groups new, changed, and planned features for that half-year period. Release wave details are available through *Release Planner* and *Release Plans*. These sources use the same underlying data, but present the data differently.

- **Release Planner** tracks feature availability and rollout progress interactively, letting your filter features and share with others. [View the release planner](https://experience.dynamics.com/releaseplans/?app=Business+Central).

- **Release Plans** describe features for specific release waves, including business value, description, and availability dates. You can also download release plans as PDFs. Select a link below for the latest Business Central versions:

  - Current wave: [2025 release wave 2](/dynamics365/release-plan/2025wave2/smb/dynamics365-business-central/planned-features)
  - Earlier waves: [Release plans for Dynamics 365 and Power Platform](/dynamics365/release-plans/).

## New and changed in recent minor updates

Minor updates are released monthly with new release wave features, regulatory updates, and critical improvements. Each update is documented in a dedicated article.

<!-- remove entries with an auto-update date older than the current month (unless the table is then pathetically short - there should always be three entries as a best practice). The links can be to articles in Docs, the planned-features article in the release plans, or KB articles with bug details. BAP Skilling does not own the individual articles with concrete information but provides tooling and guidance to help product teams, customer/partner success teams, or support teams gather relevant information.  -->

For earlier versions, visit the [Updates for earlier major versions](whatsnew-update-16-5.md) section.

## Get the latest version

New customers automatically get the latest version. If you're an existing partner/customer, check your email for notifications about updates. <!-- standard wording for apps with auto-update. If the app has an article with instruction for admins to apply an update, then link to that -->
