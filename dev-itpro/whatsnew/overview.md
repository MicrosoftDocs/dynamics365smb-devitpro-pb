# What's new or changed in Business Central

Wondering about upcoming and recently released capabilities in Dynamics 365 Business Central? We've captured all the details, end to end, top to bottom&mdash; which you can use for planning.

## Release planner and release plans

Business Central follows a six-month release cycle called a *release wave*. Each wave groups and schedules all new, changed, and planned features for that half of the year. Microsoft publishes details about features in every release wave and makes them available through the following sources. Both sources use the same underlying data, but their purpose and presentation differ. Data is updated regularly over the release wave. 

**Release Planner** presents availability and rollout progress for features across all release waves. It provides an interactive experience to track where and when features become available, letting you filter on features and share them with others. [Check out the release planner site](https://experience.dynamics.com/releaseplans/?app=Business+Central).

**Release Plans** on Microsoft Learn describe features for specific release waves. Features are organized by functiinal area, and each feature includes a business value, description, and planned public preview and general availability dates. You can also download the release plan as a single PDF.   Choose the following links to learn about the latest versions of Business Central.

- Current wave: [2025 release wave 2 (current wave)](/dynamics365/release-plan/2025wave2/smb/dynamics365-business-central/planned-features)

<!-- remove entries with an auto-update date older than the current month (unless the table is then pathetically short - there should always be three entries as a best practice). The links can be to articles in Docs, the planned-features article in the release plans, or KB articles with bug details. BAP Skilling does not own the individual articles with concrete information but provides tooling and guidance to help product teams, customer/partner success teams, or support teams gather relevant information.  -->

For earlier versions, visit the archived release plans at [Release plans for Dynamics 365 and Power Platform](/dynamics365/release-plans/archived-plans). https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/release-plans/ <!--required section-->

## Get the latest version

New customers automatically get the latest version. If you're an existing partner/customer, check your email for notifications about updates. <!-- standard wording for apps with auto-update. If the app has an article with instruction for admins to apply an update, then link to that -->
