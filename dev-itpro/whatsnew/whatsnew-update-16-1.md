## Good to know

- **Minimum requirements for Business Central Administration Center**   
We have updated system requirements with the list of browsers supported by the Administration Center. When signing in from an unsupported browser that delivers a significantly degraded experience, administrators will immediately see a message that prevents them from continuing to the Administration Center. For example, it is not possible to access the Business Central Administration Center from Internet Explorer.   
See [minimum requirements](/dynamics365/business-central/product-requirements#tac)

- **Sandbox environment picker**   
When you navigate from the Business Central Sandbox tile in the Dynamics 365 Home portal or in the App Launcher, a dialog will be displayed for you to choose exactly which sandbox environment from your organization you would like to navigate to.
