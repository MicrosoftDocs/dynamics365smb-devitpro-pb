**Migrate directly from version 14, 15, and 16 to Business Central online**  
Business Central includes a cloud migration tool that administrators can use to migrate customer data from on-premises databases to Business Central online. Starting now, the Cloud Migration app also supports migration from the earlier on-premises versions of Business Central, with the latest cumulative update applied: Migrate directly from versions 14.x, 15.x, and 16.x to version 17.x. 
This helps customers reduce their costs of migrating to the Business Central cloud significantly, as they can skip upgrading their on-premises environments to the latest version of Business Central and just migrate the data, including all historical transactions. The Cloud Migration app now includes all the necessary data upgrade logic to convert the data from the previous versions to the data structure of 2020 release wave 2 (version 17.0).
