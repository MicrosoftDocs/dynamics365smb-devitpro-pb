## Localization updates

| Country| Feature  |Description|
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| W1 | SAF-T functionality is now W1 | We've extracted SAF-T features to W1, added a generic audit file framework, and made them available as the Audit File Export extension. |
| Denmark | Export G/L entries ready to upload to Regnskab Basis |You can export general ledger details based on a standard chart of accounts as a .csv file that's ready to upload to Regnskab Basis.  |
| Spain  | Manually accept SII documents | Occasionally, the AEAT portal accepts SII documents, but returns an error anyway. When that happens, you can now manually mark the documents as accepted. When you do, the status of the document becomes **Manually Accepted** rather than **Accepted**. The new status helps you identify documents that were not accepted through the standard process.  |
| Iceland | Sales & Receivables regulatory update | On the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, we've updated the information on the **Printing** FastTab. The FastTab now shows the correct product name and regulation number. |
