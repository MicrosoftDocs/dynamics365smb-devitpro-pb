## Good to know

- Changes to Browser Cookie Policy  
Avoid disruption by following these steps to prepare for tighter security policies starting February 2020 in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. For more information, see [Preparing Dynamics NAV or Dynamics 365 Business Central for Upcoming Changes to Browser Cookie Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/prepare-for-cookie-samesite-policy).
    
- Using Internet Explorer  
From Update 15.3 onwards, users who access [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] from Internet Explorer will receive a notification suggesting they consider a different browser. Users who switch to a modern browser, such as Microsoft Edge, typically observe improved performance and a generally smoother experience. Learn more about our supported and recommended browsers for Business Central on premises and online.
    
- To support partners who are interested in monetizing the app they have published to AppSource, update 15.3 comes with new options. These options allow partners to understand number, type and state of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] licenses in the current tenant as well as number of allocated seats. That data enables the partner to implement user-based billing into their apps. To learn more, see [Azure AD Licensing](https://github.com/microsoft/ALAppExtensions/tree/master/Modules/System/Azure%20AD%20Licensing).
