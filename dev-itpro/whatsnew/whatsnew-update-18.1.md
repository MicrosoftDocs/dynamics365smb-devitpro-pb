## Good to know

**Support for migrating data from earlier on-premises versions of Business Central to 2021 release wave 1 (v.18)**  
With the Business Central cloud migration tool, customers can migrate their data from earlier on-premises versions of the product to their online Business Central environment, running on the latest version. We've added support for customers who are running on Business Central on-premises version 14, 15, 16, or 17 to migrate their data to version 18 of Business Central online. We've implemented the necessary data upgrade logic in the cloud migration tool, so customers don't have to upgrade their older version themselves in order to migrate their data to the latest online release.
