**Action needed: Client secret-based service to service authentication deprecation for Microsoft hosted tenants integrating to Dataverse**  
To ensure no disruptions in integration between Business Central and Dataverse you must upgrade your Business Central connection to Dataverse to certificate-based authentication. 
Although change will happen in March 2022, we strongly recommend you perform steps outlined in [Upgrade Connections from Business Central Online to Use Certificate-Based Authentication](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-how-to-set-up-a-dynamics-crm-connection#upgrade-connections-from-business-central-online-to-use-certificate-based-authentication) as soon as possible.

**Customer Consent capabilities for all features that exchange data with 3rd party services**  
Business Central capabilities enable companies to seamlessly integrate with other parties needed to achieve business goals or statutory obligations.

In the Setup pages for each feature interchanging data from Business Central to another service, the user will see a text informing that the affected Business Central data might be shared with third party systems and flowing outside of the organization’s selected geographic boundaries with an option to enable/disable the feature and therefore get even better control of the data share.
