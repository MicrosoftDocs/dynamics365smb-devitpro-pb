# ReadMultiple Operation
Reads a filtered set of records. This operation returns an array of entities. The ReadMultiple operation allows the consumer of a web service to specify the number of records to be returned at one time. This can reduce load on the server.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Records on a page that were inserted after the page was retrieved are not read. Records on a page may be incorrectly included in the retrieved dataset if they were deleted after the page was retrieved.  
  
## Method Signature  
 `Entity [] ReadMultiple(Entity_Filter[] filterArray, string bookmarkKey, int setSize)`  
  
## Parameters  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|*filterArray*|Type: Entity\_Filter\[\]<br /><br /> An array of record filters.|  
|*bookmarkKey*|Type: String<br /><br /> The last record bookmark of the page that was previously read.<br /><br /> To return the first page of results, set *bookmarkKey* to NULL.|  
|*setSize*|Type: Integer<br /><br /> The size of the set to be returned.<br /><br /> To return the complete set of results, set *setSize* to zero.<br /><br /> To reverse the order of the results, set *setSize* to negative.|  
  
## Results  
  
|Result name|Description|  
|-----------------|-----------------|  
|*entity\[\]*|Type: An array of Entities<br /><br /> An array of a specific object type that represents the page. Contains the latest values that are present on the page.<br /><br /> The server will return at most *setSize* records. If all records have been already returned, then subsequent calls will return no records \(a 0-element array in C\#\). You should keep calling the ReadMultiple method until no records are returned.|  
|*entity.Key*|Type: String<br /><br /> The key of the last record read. In C\#, you can access it with `Entity[Entity.Length-1].Key`. Pass this as *bookmarkKey* for the next ReadMultiple call.|  
  
## Faults  
 This operation does not throw faults when no matching records are present. Instead, it returns an empty record list.  
  
 Faults are possible if they are generated by the AL code.  
  
## Remarks  
  
## Retrieving Last Page  
 To retrieve the last record of a page, set *setSize* to -1. Using negative numbers in *setSize* sorts the records in descending order.  
  
## Entity\_Filter  
 You use the *Entity\_Filter* parameter with the ReadMultiple operation. It describes a filter that can be applied on a specific field in a record. The *Entity\_Filter* parameter contains two members: Field and Criteria.  
  
-   Field contains the name of the field that the filter is applied to. This name comes from the Entity\_Fields enum.  
  
-   Criteria is of type string and can contain any valid [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] style filter that is specified in a standard [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] filter format.  
  
## Usage Examples  
 The following example returns the first 100 customer names that start with an S.
  
```c#  
List<Customer_Filter> filterArray = new List<Customer_Filter>();  
Customer_Filter nameFilter = new Customer_Filter();  
nameFilter.Field = Customer_Fields.Name;  
nameFilter.Criteria = "S*";  
filterArray.Add(nameFilter);  
Customer[] custList = service.ReadMultiple(filterArray.ToArray(), null, 100);  
```  
  
 This example uses the *bookmarkKey* argument to read customer records in batches of 10:  
  
```c#  
Customer_Service service = new Customer_Service();  
service.UseDefaultCredentials = true;  
  
const int fetchSize = 10;  
string bookmarkKey = null;  
List<Customer> customerList = new List<Customer>();  
  
// Reads customer data in pages of 10.  
Customer[] results = service.ReadMultiple(new Customer_Filter[] { }, bookmarkKey, fetchSize);  
while (results.Length > 0)  
{  
    bookmarkKey = results.Last().Key;  
    customerList.AddRange(results);  
    results = service.ReadMultiple(new Customer_Filter[] { }, bookmarkKey, fetchSize);  
}  
  
// Prints the collected data.  
foreach (Customer customer in customerList)  
{  
    Console.WriteLine(customer.Name);  
}  
```
