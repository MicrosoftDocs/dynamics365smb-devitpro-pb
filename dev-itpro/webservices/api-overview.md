# REST API Web Services

RESTful web services are typically created to interchange data between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] and external systems. The acronym REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. Any coding language capable of calling REST APIs can be used to use this feature. The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] API stack have been optimized for performance and is the preferred way to integrate with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] comes with an extensive list of built-in APIs that requires no code and minimal setup to use. When using the built-in APIs, please choose the highest API version available. You can also develop your own custom APIs using the AL object types _API pages_ and _API queries._

The articles in this section describe the key concepts and techniques for using APIs with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)].
