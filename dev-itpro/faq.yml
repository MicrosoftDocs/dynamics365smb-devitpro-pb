        answer: |
          For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online, there is a limit to how much database storage capacity we allow each tenant to use for their environments (databases).

          The Outlook add-in is designed to function as a business inbox in Outlook, based on the standard [!INCLUDE [prod_short](developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online. If you are using a different type of deployment, such as a solution that is part of the Embed App program, then you must set up an Azure Key Vault and specify secrets for TEMPORARYDOCUMENTSTORAGEACCOUNT and TEMPORARYDOCUMENTSTORAGEKEY. For more information, see [Using Key Vault Secrets in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](developer/includes/prod_short.md)] Extensions](developer/devenv-app-key-vault.md).  
          
      - question: Is the Windows client supported?
        answer: |
          The first releases of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on premises included an installed client derived from Microsoft Dynamics NAV. Starting with 2019 release wave 2, this legacy component, referred to as "the Windows client", will no longer be available for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [FAQ About the Windows Client and Business Central](faq-win-cli.md).

        answer: |
          If you have a background with [!INCLUDE [navnow_md](developer/includes/navnow_md.md)], you will find that in-product Help is very different in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](developer/includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [User Assistance Model](user-assistance.md).
          
      - question: Which IP addresses or ranges does my environment's API use?
        answer: |
          When you exchange data through the API, you might have to safe list the IP addresses. The addresses depend on the direction of the call.
          
          - Inbound
          
            Inbound requests go into the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] API, for example through OData calls. The requests go to the `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com` URL that currently resolves to IP addresses in the IP ranges of the following Azure regions:
          
            - Australia East
            - West Europe
            - East US
          
            > [!IMPORTANT]
            > Data routed through `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com` is not *stored* in these regions. The data *transits* through them.  
          
            We reserve the right to change the list of Azure regions used by the `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com` URL without prior announcement. We will, however, update this guidance accordingly once such a change is implemented.  
            
          - Outbound
          
            Outbound requests come from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment, such as code that uses the `HttpClient`data type to send HTTP requests. The requests come from an IP address in the IP ranges of the Azure region in which the environment is hosted. You can see where an environment is hosted on the **Environment details** page in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] admin center. For more information, see [Managing Environments](administration/tenant-admin-center-environments.md).  
          
          You can find the IP addresses of the Azure regions [as a download on the Download center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56519).
