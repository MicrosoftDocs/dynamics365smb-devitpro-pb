# Monitoring Business Central Server Using Performance Counters
Performance counters provide information about how well [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] is operating. By using monitoring tools such as Windows Performance Monitor <!-- remove temporarily until we determine support for this and System Center Operations Manager,--> you can use the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] performance counters to collect data on [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instances, and then use the data to identify conditions that are affecting performance and make adjustments.  

 [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] also provides a Data Collector Set template that you can use to easily create Data Collector Sets that contain all the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] performance counters.
