# Get Started as a Reseller of Business Central Online

If you want to build your business on [!INCLUDE [prodlong](../developer/includes/prodlong.md)] online, you must get set up as a reseller in the Microsoft Partner Center. We also recommend that you join [The “Ready to Go” Program](../developer/readiness/readiness-ready-to-go.md).  

## Get set up in the Partner Center

[!INCLUDE [csp-get-started](../developer/includes/csp-get-started.md)]

[!INCLUDE [csp-admin-users](../developer/includes/csp-admin-users.md)]

### Add users from your own organization

In most cases, your partner company includes employees with different responsibilities, and you can assign different roles depending on people's responsibility. This way, you can be very explicit about who from your staff can access your customers' data, for example.

For each user you can assign permissions for 2 categories of tasks: 

- Managing your organization's account

  This controls access to the functionality of the Partner Center portal
- Assisting your customers

  This controls access to your customers' environments

When you add a user from your organization, and you choose the **Assists your customers as** field, you must specify the relevant role for this user to be able to login in to your customers' [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] environments, *Admin agent* or *Helpdesk agent*.  

These users can manage implementation, support, and troubleshooting tasks for your customers. Once the reseller relationship with a customer is established, they will be able to login into the [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] environments of the customer without a license. The number of partner users that can access customer environments is not restricted.  

This way of accessing customer resources is called *delegated administration*, and the partner users are therefore called *delegated administrators* or *delegated admins* in daily shorthand.  

Both roles will provide your users with exactly the same level of access to the customer's [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] environment. However, they have very different capabilities to manage the customer's Active Directory and other subscriptions that the customer might have. For more information, see [Admin roles](/office365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide#roles-available-in-the-microsoft-365-admin-center).  

> [!NOTE]
> These users cannot provide accounting services for the customers. For this purpose, the customers must use the **External Accountant** license which is also available via CSP.  

[!INCLUDE [admin-partneruser](../developer/includes/admin-partneruser.md)]

## Join the Ready to Go program

The “Ready to Go” program is designed to support you in the journey of bringing offerings to market. The program contains learning, coaching, and tooling. For more information, see [Ready to Go](../developer/readiness/readiness-ready-to-go.md).  

## Help your customers get started

When you onboard customers to [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)], you have access to their account as a delegated administrator and can help them get things set up. For more information, see [Administration of Business Central Online](tenant-administration.md).  

### Connect with customers

[!INCLUDE [csp-connect-customer](../developer/includes/csp-connect-customer.md)]
[!INCLUDE [csp-disconnect-customer](../developer/includes/csp-disconnect-customer.md)]

### Give powerful demos

You can create a trial environment based on the [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] content pack in [cdx.transform.microsoft.com](https://cdx.transform.microsoft.com/).  

For more information, see [Preparing Demonstration Environments of [!INCLUDE[prodlong](../developer/includes/prodlong.md)]](../administration/demo-environment.md).  

[!INCLUDE [perf-demo](../developer/includes/perf-demo.md)]
