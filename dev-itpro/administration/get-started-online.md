# Get started as a reseller of Business Central online

If you want to build your business on [!INCLUDE [prod_long](../developer/includes/prod_long.md)] online, you must get set up as a reseller in the Microsoft Partner Center. In this article, we take you through the first steps in your journey.  

## Step 1: Become a partner

Becoming a Microsoft partner gives you access to the Microsoft resources needed to sell solutions. The steps in this section below are required to gain access to the programs that enable are intended to help you get set up to sell [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].

In order to be able to service [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] licenses and provide help and support to your customers, your company must have a [Microsoft Partner ID](/partner-center/mpn-overview) (MPN ID), and you must enroll in the [Cloud Solution Provider](/partner-center/csp-overview) (CSP) program.

[!INCLUDE [admin-partner-mpn](../developer/includes/admin-partner-mpn.md)]

[!INCLUDE [csp-get-started](../developer/includes/csp-get-started.md)]

[!INCLUDE [csp-admin-users](../developer/includes/csp-admin-users.md)]

For more information, see [Delegated Administrator Access to Business Central Online](delegated-admin.md).  

## Step 2: Go to market

When you become a Microsoft Partner Network member, you gain access to membership benefits that can help you build and grow your business. For more information, see [Explore your Go-To-Market with Microsoft offers](/partner-center/mpn-learn-about-go-to-market-benefits) in the Partner Center docs.  

As a Dynamics 365 reseller, you benefit from Microsoft's investments in an always up-to-date modern platform, you can bundle recognized apps from the Microsoft commercial marketplace into an offering that fits the needs of your customers, reach more customers by using Microsoft's commercial marketplace to promote your packaged consulting service offerings or customization services, and streamline your own processes and build tools with Power BI, Power Automate, and Power Apps connected to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].  

The [Dynamics 365 Business Central Partner Portal](https://dynamicspartners.transform.microsoft.com/products/dynamics-365-business-central) landing site has plenty of material to help you build a practice, go to market, drive readiness, and keep track of upcoming events (requires a partner account).  

### Marketing assets

Microsoft provides marketing assets that you can use to build a business based on Microsoft. For more information, see the following sites:

* [Partner Network resources](https://partner.microsoft.com/asset#/?type=marketing-campaigns&area=mrkt)  
* [Brand and trademark basics for partners](https://partner.microsoft.com/marketing/branding)  
* [Go-to-market with Microsoft](https://partner.microsoft.com/solutions/go-to-market)  

Specifically for going to market with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], Microsoft provides resources and guidance on the [Business Applications for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs)](https://partner.microsoft.com/solutions/business-applications/smb) site. For more information, see [Business Central Go-To-Market resources](https://partner.microsoft.com/asset/collection/business-central-go-to-market-resources#/).  

## Step 3: Give powerful demos

You can create a trial environment based on content in [cdx.transform.microsoft.com](https://cdx.transform.microsoft.com/).  

For more information, see [Preparing Demonstration Environments of [!INCLUDE[prod_long](../developer/includes/prod_long.md)]](../administration/demo-environment.md).  

## Step 4: Help your customers get started

When you onboard customers to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], you have access to their account as a delegated administrator and can help them get things set up. For more information, see [Administration of Business Central Online](tenant-administration.md).  

### Connect with customers

[!INCLUDE [csp-connect-customer](../developer/includes/csp-connect-customer.md)]
[!INCLUDE [csp-disconnect-customer](../developer/includes/csp-disconnect-customer.md)]

### Get Business Central right for the customer

The default version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] is just that - a default version. In many cases, you'll enhance the default version with [apps from the Microsoft commercial marketplace](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-extensions). But you can also [customize pages for a profile](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-personalization-manage) and [change which UI elements are visible](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-experiences). For more information, see [Customize Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-customizing-overview) in the business functionality content.  

If your customer wants more tweaks, you can create customizations of profiles and pages in code. For more information, see [Customizing the User Interface for User Roles](../developer/devenv-role-customization.md) in the developer content.  

You can also use [configuration packages](set-up-standard-company-configuration-packages.md) to quickly apply the same settings as usual to new environments.

### Move the customer from a trial to a paid subscription

If your customer decides to start using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] to run their business, they must switch to a paid subscription. Both the internal admin and the delegated admin can assign licenses to users in the Microsoft 365 admin center. For more information, see [Buy or remove licenses](/microsoft-365/commerce/licenses/buy-licenses?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true) in the Microsoft 365 content.  

[!INCLUDE [admin-license-trial](../includes/admin-license-trial.md)]

If the customer has tried out [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] using a pre-configured demonstration company that [you have prepared](demo-environment.md) in other ways, they can now sign up for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] using their own work or school account so that you can assign the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] license to their Microsoft 365 tenant.  

You can help them migrate their data from their legacy system. For more information, see [Migrate On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](migrate-data.md).

## Step 5: Configure the support experience

As a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] reselling partner, you are an administrator of your customers' [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] tenants, and you are the first line of support. This means that you will get requests for support from your customers that you must triage, investigate, and either resolve or escalate to Microsoft.  

[!INCLUDE [admin-supportplan](../includes/admin-supportplan.md)]

For more information, see [Technical Support for Business Central](../technical-support.md) and [Managing Technical Support](manage-technical-support.md).  

## Step 6: Maintain your customers' Business Central

As a Business Central reselling partner, you are the administrator of the Business Central tenants of your customers. You are expected to help your customers maintain their solution, including [setting the upgrade window](tenant-admin-center-update-management.md#set-the-update-window-for-each-environment), [monitoring telemetry](tenant-admin-center-telemetry.md), [updating customizations](../developer/app-maintain.md), and [managing apps](tenant-admin-center-manage-apps.md).  

For more information, see [Administration of Business Central Online](tenant-administration.md) and [The Business Central Administration Center](tenant-admin-center.md).

## Preparing for Business Central online

If you’re a partner on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises preparing to move to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online, the following sections are some of the things to keep in mind. The sections describe the most important differences between [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises and online customers.

> [!NOTE]
> To start selling [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online, you must become familiar with several core Microsoft Cloud concepts like tenant, indirect reseller, CSP, MCA, and regions. These concepts aren’t unique to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online—they are part of a common foundation used across Microsoft 365, Azure, and the Dynamics 365 product family. You’re not just preparing to sell one product by learning these standards; you’re equipping yourself with the skills and knowledge to support a broad range of Microsoft cloud solutions.

### Indirect reseller

In an on-premises setup, you order licenses for your customers directly from Microsoft. In the online model, in most cases, you become an indirect reseller and must sign an agreement with an indirect provider (under the CSP program). As an indirect reseller, you don’t order licenses from Microsoft directly—instead, you transact with your chosen indirect provider.

![Dynamics 365 Business Central distributed through the CSP channel.](../media/business-central-csp.svg "Business Central distributed through the CSP channel")

Learn more about the [Cloud Solution Provider](/partner-center/csp-overview) (CSP) program.

### License ordering and customer management

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you use PartnerSource to order new licenses, renumber objects, and include add-ons. After each change, you need to generate a new license file and manually update the license in the customer database.
In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online, you place orders through your indirect provider's portal and manage customers in the Microsoft Partner Center. The process is more streamlined—you no longer need to generate license files or renumber objects. Subscriptions or additional users are available to your customers immediately after purchase; which means that no manual license installation is required. You also add apps using Microsoft Marketplace.

Learn more and see the [examples of what you can achieve on Partner Center](/partner-center/customers/connect-with-your-customers?toc=%2Fdynamics365%2Fbusiness-central%2Fdev-itpro%2Ftoc.json).

### Microsoft Entra tenants

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online operates within the broader Microsoft cloud ecosystem. Most customers already have a tenant before they adapt [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], so you must identify the customer's tenant when assigning new licenses. This way, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] integrates with many other apps the customer already uses, like Excel, Outlook, Power BI, or Dynamics 365 Sales.

Learn more about tenants in [Infrastructure of Business Central online](tenant-environment-topology.md).

### Delegated administration and administration center

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online, it’s much easier to access and support the customers, mostly due to the two assets unavailable in the on-premises setup; the delegated administration and administration center.
Delegated administration allows the partner to access the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] environment with the customer's approval. This doesn’t require any special configuration or separate [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] licenses for your consultants. Administration Center is where you can manage customers' environments, updates, or telemetry.

Learn more about [Delegated administration](delegated-admin.md) and [Administration center](tenant-admin-center.md).

### Multiple licensing partners

In an on-premises model, each customer has one partner who manages its license. The customer can designate additional partners who act as consultants. However, these partners have limited options. The setup in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online is different. The CSP (Cloud Solution Provider) model allows many different Microsoft resellers to sell subscriptions to the same customer. This way, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online customers can have multiple partners providing them with the licenses.

Learn more about [trials and subscriptions in Business Central online](trials-subscriptions.md).

### Marketplace transactability

Apps that extend [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online functionality are published on Marketplace. Pay special attention to the Marketplace transactability. This is the option to purchase the app directly through Marketplace. An increasing number of apps have the transactability option enabled. They can be added to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] in two ways:

* Customer purchases the app directly from the ISV.
* Indirect reseller (you) purchases the app from the ISV through the indirect provider.

Both ways are different from the on-premises model, where you act as a managing partner for the customer. In the on-premises model, you usually transact directly with the ISV and then add the application to the customer license on PartnerSource.

Learn more in [selling Business Central apps through Marketplace](../developer/devenv-sell-apps-appsource.md).

### Regions

The CSP program contains the so-called region availability. This means that based on your company's location, you’re part of one of the regions and can sell CSP offers (including [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]) only within that region. For example, if your company's location is in Europe, you can sell to customers in Europe and cannot sell to customers in the United States.

Learn more about [CSP regions](/partner-center/enroll/regional-authorization-overview).

### AIM and Bridge to Cloud 2

These are the default programs designed to assist in migrating on-premises customers to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online. Learn more in [AIM and Bridge to Cloud 2](https://dynamicspartners.transform.microsoft.com/program/aim-migration).

### Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA)

[!INCLUDE [prod_long](../includes/prod_long.md)] on-premises customers are bound by the Microsoft Software License Terms specific to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. Don’t look for special license terms for [!INCLUDE [prod_long](../includes/prod_long.md)] online. Customers are bound by the Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA), which applies to all Microsoft cloud products and services, including Azure, Microsoft 365, and Dynamics 365.

Learn more in the [Microsoft Customer Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/customeragreement).

### Pricing model differences

The core licensing model is similar in both on-premises and online deployments—customers are primarily charged based on the number of users, the licenses are: Essentials, Premium, Device, or Team Members. However, there are some important differences. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online, customers don’t pay for objects. In most cases, they don’t need additional licenses for their partners who provide support, because partners can access their environments with delegated admin permissions. Instead, they may incur costs for production environments (Additional Environment Addon) and storage (Database Capacity), which don’t apply to the on-premises model.

Learn more in the [Microsoft Dynamics Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).
