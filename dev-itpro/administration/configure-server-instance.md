# Configuring Business Central Server

When you run [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] Setup and install [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)], you provide information that is then used as the configuration for the default [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance. This information is stored in a configuration file for the server instance called CustomSetting.config. The default location of the CustomSettings.config file is *[!INCLUDE[prodinstallpath](../developer/includes/prodinstallpath.md)]\Service*. 

After you install [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)], you can change any of the settings, including other settings that weren't available to you in Setup.

> [!NOTE]  
> Each [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance has its own CustomSettings.config file.  

## Configuring [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] in Setup
 
You configure the default instance of [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] by running [!INCLUDE[prod setup](../developer/includes/prodsetup.md)] and selecting one of the following options: 

- Demo Option
- Server Option
- Developer Option
- Customize > Server 

After you specify an installation option or customize your component list, the **Specify parameters** pane is displayed in Setup. The list of parameters that you see depends on which components you've selected for configuration. Setup provides a short description for each parameter. 

## Configuring [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] After Installation
  
After you install [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)], you can change the configuration settings in the CustomSettings.config file of a [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance in the following ways:  

- Using the [!INCLUDE[admintool](../developer/includes/admintool.md)].

    For more information, see [Settings in the Business Central Server Administration Tool](configure-server-instance.md#NavAdminSettings) and [Business Central Server Administration Tool](Administration-Tool.md).  

- Using the [Set-NAVServerConfiguration cmdlet](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=401394) that is available in the [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)].

    For more information, see [Using Administration Shell Cmdlets to Modify Settings](configure-server-instance.md#UsingPowerShell).  

- By directly editing CustomSettings.config using a text editor.

    We recommend that you don't directly edit the configuration file. If you make any errors in typing, the server instance might not start.  

### Restarting [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] after modifications

If you use the [!INCLUDE[admintool](../developer/includes/admintool.md)] or modify the CustomSettings.config file directly, you must restart the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance before any changes can take effect.

The [Set-NAVServerConfiguration cmdlet](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=401394) doesn't always require restarting the server instance. It depends on the configuration setting that you change. There are several settings that are *dynamically updatable*. *Dynamically updatable* means that a server instance restart isn't necessarily required after modification. For more information, see [Modifying dynamically updatable settings](configure-server-instance.md#DynamicSettings).

These settings are indicated by the text **Dynamically Updatable: Yes** in the tables that follow,

##  <a name="NavAdminSettings"></a>[!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] Instance Settings
  
This section describes all the configuration settings for a [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance. The settings are grouped according to the tabs under which they appear in the [!INCLUDE[admintool](../developer/includes/admintool.md)].
- The **Setting** column displays the name of the setting as it appears in the [!INCLUDE[admintool](../developer/includes/admintool.md)].
- The **Key Name** column displays the name of the setting as it appears in the CustomSettings.config file. It's also the name for the setting when you run the Set-NAVServerConfiguration cmdlet.

##  <a name="General"></a> General Settings
  
The following table describes fields on the **General** tab in the [!INCLUDE[admintool](../developer/includes/admintool.md)].  

|Setting|Key Name|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](../developer/includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|  
|-------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Application Insights Instrumentation Key|ApplicationInsightsInstrumentationKey|Specifies the instrumentation key of the Microsoft Azure Application Insights resource to use for gathering and analyzing telemetry data emitted by the server instance. When this setting is configured, the server instance will send telemetry data to Application Insights for analysis and presentation.<br /><br /> This setting only applies to a server instance that is configured as a single-tenant instance (**Multitenant** setting is disabled). For a multitenant server instance, this setting is ignored. You set the Application Insights instrumentation key on a per-tenant basis, when you mount tenants.<br /><br />For more information, see [Enable Sending Telemetry to Application Insights](telemetry-enable-application-insights.md).<br /><br />Default: empty<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|  
|Build Restriction|ClientBuildRestriction|Specifies what happens when a [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] client tries to connect to the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance when the client is running a different build version of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] than the server instance.<br /><br /> Values:<br /><br />**AlwaysConnect**<br /><br />**WarnClient**<br /> Before connecting the client to the server instance, a message appears that informs the user that the build versions for the client and server instance are different. The user can choose to continue or cancel the connection.<br /><br /> **DoNotAllow**<br /> A message appears that informs the user that the client and server instance build versions are different. The client doesn't connect to the server instance.<br /><br /> **Note:** With the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](../developer/includes/nav_web_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_tablet](../developer/includes/nav_tablet_md.md)], this setting compares the build version of the [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] on IIS with the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance. It controls the connection between [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] and the server instance.<br /><br /> Default: WarnClient<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|  
|Certificate Thumbprint|ServicesCertificateThumbprint|If you use security certificates to protect communications between [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] and client services or web services over an open or wide-area network, you must provide the certificate thumbprint to [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] by updating this setting. For more information, see [Using Security Certificates](../deployment/implement-security-certificates-production-environment.md).<br /><br />Default: <br />Dynamically Updatable: No|  
|Compile and Load Business Application|CompileBusinessApplicationAtStartup|Specifies whether the server instance compiles business application assemblies and loads them to cache memory when it starts. The assemblies are then retrieved from memory when requested by a [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] client.<br /><br /> This setting reduces the time it takes to load application objects the first time the client requests them after the server instance has started. However, it will also slightly increase the memory usage by the server instance.<br /><br />When the server instance starts for the first time, it compiles the business application assemblies and loads them to the cache memory of the computer. The assemblies, along with metadata such object timestamp information, are also stored to a temporary folder on the computer's file system. When the server instance is restarted, it compares the assemblies stored in memory with corresponding objects in the connected database. An assembly will be reused if the following conditions are met:<br /><br />- The connected database is the same as before, based on the *databasemagic* field in the property table.<br /><br />- The object time stamp that is recorded on the compiled assembly matches the object timestamp in metadata of the connected database.<br /><br />If the conditions aren't met for an assembly or an assembly for an object in the database isn't found in the memory, then a new assembly is built and stored for reuse to cache memory and the file system of the server instance compute for reuse.<br /><br />If you disable this setting, individual assemblies will be compiled on-demand as application objects are requested by the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] client. The compiled assemblies won't be reused on later server instance restarts.<br /><br />Notes:<ul><li>This setting doesn't apply to query objects.</li><li>Assembly compilation happens asynchronously.</li><li>On average, all application objects will be loaded within the first few minutes that the server instance operates.</li></ul><br />Default: Enabled<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|  
|Credential Type|ClientServicesCredentialType|Specifies the authentication mechanism for [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] users of the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance.<br /><br /> The options are **Windows**, **Username**, **NavUserPassword**, **AccessControlService**, and **None**. For more information, see [Authentication and User Credential Types](Users-Credential-Types.md).<br /><br /> If you choose **AccessControlService**, you must specify a federation metadata location for use with Azure AD. If you choose **NavUserPassword** and specify a token signing key, you can use both NavUserPassword and AccessControlService.<br /><br />Notes:<ul><li>**None** is for internal use on system sessions and typically shouldn't be used. If you choose **None**, then the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance can't start.</li><li>**ExchangeIdentity** and **TaskScheduler** are for internal use only, and shouldn't be used.</li></ul><br />Default: Windows<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|

|Default Language|DefaultLanguage|Specifies which of the installed [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] languages on the server instance will be used as the default language in the clients. Set the value to a valid language culture name, such en-US or da-DK.<br /><br /> In the web and tablet clients, this setting determines the language used if the browser's language setting doesn't match any installed language or a language in the **Supported Languages** setting. In the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] Windows client, this value is used if the language setting of the computer doesn't have a match.<br /><br />If there are application-specific configuration settings, this setting will be overridden by the default language setting that is specified in application-specific configuration file. For more information, see [Set-NAVServerAppConfiguration cmdlet](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=827798).<br /><br /> Default: en-US<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|
|  Diagnostic Trace Level  |TraceLevel|  Specifies the lowest severity level of custom telemetry events to be emitted and recorded in the event log for the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance. The events include system telemetry trace events and custom telemetry events. Telemetry events have IDs from  700-706. <br /><br />The setting has the following values, which correspond to the event severity levels (listed from highest to lowest level): **Critical**, **Error**, **Warning**, **Normal** (this value corresponds to the **Information** level), **Verbose**, and **Off**.<br /><br />You use this setting to filter out lower-level events from the log. For example, if you set this setting to **Error**, only **Error** and **Critical** events will be logged.<br /><br />Set to **Off** if you don't want to record telemetry events. When set to **Off**, events aren't emitted.<br /><br />**Note:** Telemetry trace events are recorded in the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] channel logs, which you can see in Event Viewer, under **Applications and Services Logs** > **Microsoft** > **Dynamics365BusinessCentral** > **Common** > **Admin**.<br /><br />Default: Normal<br />Dynamically Updatable: Yes|  
|Diagnostic Trace Level for External Proxies|ExternalTraceLevel|Specifies the lowest severity level of telemetry events from external proxies that you want the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance to emit if an error related to the external system occurs on the server instance. This setting pertains to systems and components that [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] integrates with, like [!INCLUDE[crm_md](../developer/includes/crm_md.md)] (CRM/Xrm).<br /><br />The server instance listens for event traces from the external proxy. If an error occurs on the server instance, it will emit the last 10 telemetry trace events from the external proxy. The trace events can then be recorded in the Windows event log or picked up by other event trace collection tools.<br /><br />The setting has the following values, which correspond to the event severity levels (listed from highest to lowest level): **Critical**, **Error**, **Warning**, **Information**, **Verbose**, and **Off**.<br /><br />Events that have a lower severity level than the set value won't be emitted. For example, if you set this setting to **Error**, only **Error** and **Critical** events will be emitted. Set to **Off** if you don't want to emit any of these events.<br /><br />Default: Error<br />Dynamically Updatable: Yes| 
|Disable Token-Signing Certificate Validation|DisableTokenSigningCertificateValidation|Specifies whether to enable or disable the validation of the token-signing certificate used by Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS).

Application objects are compiled with debug information.<br /><br /> Default: Not enabled<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|  
|Enable Event Logging to Windows Application Log|EnableApplicationChannelLog|Specifies whether to record admin and operational type events in the **Windows Application** log. This setting will record errors, warnings, and information messages that occur on server instance. The events are stored on the computer that is running [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)].<br /><br /> Because [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance events are always logged to the **Application and Services Logs**, you can disable logging [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance events in the Windows Application log and not lose any data. For more information, see [Monitoring Business Central Server Events Using Event Viewer](monitor-server-events-windows-event-log.md) and [Disable Logging Events to the Windows Application Log](disable-Logging-Events-Windows-Application-Log.md).<br /><br /> **Important:** If you 're using System Center Operations Manager to monitor [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instances, don't disable logging to the Windows Application log.

## <a name="Upgrade"></a>Upgrade Settings

[!INCLUDE[2019_releasewave2.md](../includes/2019_releasewave2.md)]

The following table describes fields on the **Upgrade** tab in the [!INCLUDE[admintool](../developer/includes/admintool.md)].

|  Setting  |Key Name|  Description  |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
|Integration Records Table (ID)|IntegrationRecordsTableId|Specifies the ID of the application table that is used to store integration record IDs. This setting only applies when you upgrade from Business Central Spring 2019 (version 14) to Business Central 2019 release wave 2 (version 15). It ensures that current integration record IDs that are used in the application can be used as-is after upgrade. <br /><br />When a database is upgraded, a **SystemId** column will be added to the **Integration Records** table, and each record in the table will be assigned a **SystemId** value. The base application looks to this column to identify integration records. If you specify the **Integration Records Table (ID)** setting, the data upgrade process will set the **SystemId** to the same value as integration record ID; otherwise, the value is randomly assigned by the system. <br /><br />If you aren't upgrading to the Business Central 2019 release wave 2 base application, you can either skip this upgrade step by setting the value to 0. This is the case, when you've a fully customized application or you're only doing a technical upgrade. Or, if you 're using a different integration record table than **5151 Integration Record**, set the value to ID of your custom integration record table. The custom integration record table must include the following columns as a minimum (with exact naming): Integration ID, Record ID, Table ID. <br /> <br />Default: 5151<br />Dynamically Updatable: Yes|
|*not available*|DestinationAppsForMigration| Specifies the extensions that Microsoft and 3rd-party extensions have a dependency on. The dependencies typically include the base application, system application, and test application. Only use this setting when upgrading from [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] Spring 2019. The setting is used during the data upgrade process. If configured, when an extension is published, the server instance will automatically modify the manifest of the extension to include the required dependencies.<br /> <br />Default: <br />Dynamically Updatable: No|

##  <a name="UsingPowerShell"></a> Using [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)] to Modify Server Instance Settings
  
The [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)] includes several `Set-` cmdlets that enable you to create and modify [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instances.

The main cmdlet for configuring a server instance is the Set-NAVServerConfiguration cmdlet. You can use this cmdlet to change any of the configuration settings that are listed in the previous sections. To change a configuration setting, you set `-KeyName` parameter to the **Key Name** that corresponds to the setting, and set the `-KeyValue`parameter to the new value. For example, you can change the value for `DatabaseServer` to `DatabaseServer.Domain.Com` for the server instance named `MyInstance` by executing this cmdlet:  

```  
Set-NAVServerConfiguration -ServerInstance "MyInstance" -KeyName "DatabaseServer" -KeyValue "DatabaseServer.Domain.Com"  
```  

## <a name="DynamicSettings"></a>Modifying dynamically updatable settings

For dynamically updatable settings, use the `-ApplyTo` parameter to specify how to apply the change. The change can be written directly to the configuration file (CustomSettings.config) and applied to the current server instance state. The option you choose will determine whether a server instance restart is required for the change to take effect. The parameter has three options, as described in the following table:

|  Option |Description  |
|-----------|-----------|
|ConfigFile|Saves the change to the configuration file of the server instance. The change won't take effect until the server instance is restarted.|
|Memory|Applies the change only to the server instance's current state. The changes take effect immediately, without having to restart the server instance. The change is stored in memory. The next time the server instance is restarted, it reverts to the setting in the configuration file.|
|All|Applies the change to the server instance's current setting state (in memory) and to the configuration file. The changes take effect immediately, without having to restart the server instance.|

For example, the following command sets the value for the `MaxStreamReadSize` key to `42424242`, without having to restart the server instance. 

```  
Set-NAVServerConfiguration -ServerInstanceMyInstance -KeyName MaxStreamReadSize -KeyValue 42424242 -ApplyTo Memory  
```
