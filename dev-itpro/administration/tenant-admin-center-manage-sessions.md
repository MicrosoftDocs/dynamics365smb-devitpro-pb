# Managing Sessions in the Admin Center

For each environment in the [!INCLUDE[prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)], you can use the **Manage Sessions** page to view information about active sessions on an environment and cancel selected sessions.

To open the page, select **Manage Sessions**. Use the **Show session details** check box to show more or fewer details.

## Cancel sessions

Canceling a session is sometimes the only way to unblock a customer. For example, a long-running report is locking data in a table, preventing warehouse employees from working.

To cancel a session, select it from the list and then select **Cancel selected sessions**.
