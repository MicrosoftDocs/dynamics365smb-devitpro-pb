# Analyzing Long Running Operation (SQL Query) Telemetry

Any SQL query that takes longer than 1000 milliseconds to execute will be sent to your Azure Application Insights resource. This enables you to focus on tuning SQL queries that take too long to execute (maybe one or more tables miss an index or maybe some filters are missing). It also reduces the ingestion of data into the Azure Application Insights resource to save cost of having telemetry.

With Business Central online, if you want to capture all SQL queries for a short period of time for a given session, you can enable **Additional logging** from the **Help & Support** page. This lets you analyze queries that take a short time to run but happen very frequently. <!--Additional logging is currently only available on production environments running version 17.4 or later.-->

> [!NOTE]
> With Business Central On-premises, you can change the threshold that defines long running queries. For more information, see [Defining Long Running SQL Queries Threshold](monitor-long-running-sql-queries-event-log.md#threshold).

There are multiple reasons that affect the time it takes SQL queries to run. For example, the database could be waiting for a lock to be released. Or, the database is executing an operation that does badly because of missing indexes. Sometimes you can look at the SQL statement that was generated by the code to see what caused the delay. This information is found in the **CustomDimension** data, specifically the **AL Stack Trace** column.

## <a name="LRSQLQuery"></a>Dimensions in Application Insights

This table explains the columns included in long running query events emitted to Application Insights. Bold text indicates that the value of the columns is a constant. Some columns are standard for Application Insights. These columns are indicated by *Application Insights*.

|Column|Description or value|
|---------|-----|
|timestamp|Specifies the date and time that the long running query event occurred, such as 2019-08-20T07:23:07.9996696Z|
|message|Version 16.1 and later:<br />**Operation exceeded time threshold (SQL query)**<br /><br />Before version 16.1:<br />**Action took longer than expected**|
|severityLevel|**2** (This level indicates a warning. Long running queries are always recorded as warnings)|
|itemType|**trace**|
|customDimensions|(see table that follows)|
|operation_Name|**Long Running Operation (SQL Query)**<br /><br />**Note:** The use of the `operation_Name` column was deprecated in version 16.1. In future versions, data won't be stored in this column. So in version 16.1 and later, use the custom dimension column `eventID` column custom in Kusto queries instead of `operation_Name`.|
|operation_Id|Specifies the GUID assigned to the client operation. An operation is created whenever the user does something in the client, such as selecting an action.|
|operation_ParentId|Currently this column is the same as the operation_Id. This behavior might change in a future release.|
|session_Id|Specifies the GUID of the client session. When a client makes a connection to the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance, a session is created and assigned an ID. |
|client_Type|*Application Insights*|
|client_IP|*Application Insights*|
|client_City|*Application Insights*|
|client_StateOrProvince|*Application Insights*|
|client_CountryOrRegion|*Application Insights*|
|cloud_RoleName|Specifies the display name of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] tenant. For on-premises, this value is the same as the cloud_RoleInstance.  |
|cloud_RoleInstance|Specifies the name of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] tenant. |
|appId|*Application Insights*|
|appName|*Application Insights*|
|iKey|*Application Insights*|
|sdkVersion|*Application Insights*|
