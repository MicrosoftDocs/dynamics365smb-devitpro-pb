# Troubleshooting: Using the Event Viewer to Monitor Long Running SQL Queries in Dynamics NAV

This topic shows how you can use the Event Viewer to monitor long running SQL queries and decide which ones can be candidates for optimization. 


## Resolution
Identifying long running SQL queries can be a good starting point when doing a performance analysis. To find which SQL queries performed slower than expected, open the Event Viewer and go to the Windows Logs Application. 

> [!NOTE]  
> The SQL queries that exceed the set threshold will be displayed in the Application window of the Event Viewer as *Warning*. 

If the value of the [SqlLongRunningThreshold](Configuring-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server.md) key was set to the default value of 1000 milliseconds, you will see the message: "*Action completed successfully, but it took longer than the given threshold.*" for actions that took longer than that. To meet your performance expections in production, you can set the threshold to a different value without doing a server restart. For more information on how you can do this, see [Monitoring Long Running SQL Queries using the Event Log](Monitoring-Long-Running-SQL-Queries-Event-Log.md).

In some cases, you can see what caused the delay by looking at the SQL statement that was generated by the code listed in the `AL CallStack` column. The code below shows which AL method generated a slow performing query.
