# Escalate Support Issues to Microsoft

It might happen that a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online customer runs into a technical problem that the partner cannot resolve. In those cases, the delegated admin can use the Partner Center or the [!INCLUDE [prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)] to submit a support request to Microsoft.  

> [!NOTE]
> The internal administrator cannot contact Microsoft directly. If you are an internal admin and suspect that something is wrong with your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can use the [!INCLUDE [prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)] to troubleshoot. To go further than that, you must contact your partner for next steps.
