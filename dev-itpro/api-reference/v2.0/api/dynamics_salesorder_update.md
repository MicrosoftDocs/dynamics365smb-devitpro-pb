# Update salesOrders

[!INCLUDE[api_v2_note](../../../includes/api_v2_note.md)]

Update the properties of a sales orders object for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../../includes/prod_short.md)].

## HTTP request

```
PATCH businesscentralPrefix/companies({id})/salesOrders({id})
```

## Request headers

|Header|Value|
|------|-----|
|Authorization |Bearer {token}. Required.|
|Content-Type  |application/json|
|If-Match      |Required. When this request header is included and the eTag provided does not match the current tag on the **salesOrders**, the **salesOrders** will not be updated. |
