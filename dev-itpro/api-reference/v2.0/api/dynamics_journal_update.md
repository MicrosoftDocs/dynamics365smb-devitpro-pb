# Update journals

[!INCLUDE[api_v2_note](../../../includes/api_v2_note.md)]

Update the properties of a journal object for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../../includes/prod_short.md)].

## HTTP request

```
PATCH businesscentralPrefix/companies({id})/journals({id})
```

|--------------|-------------------------|
|Authorization |Bearer {token}. Required.|
|Content-Type  |application/json         |
|If-Match      |Required. When this request header is included and the eTag provided does not match the current tag on the **journals**, the **journals** will not be updated. |

## Request body
