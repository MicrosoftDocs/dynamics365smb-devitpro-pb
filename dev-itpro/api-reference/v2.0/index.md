# Welcome to the API (v2.0) for Business Central

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] you can create Connect apps. Connect apps establish a point-to-point connection between Dynamics 365 Business Central and a 3rd party solution or service and is typically created using standard REST API to interchange data. Any coding language capable of calling REST APIs can be used to develop your Connect app. For more information to get started with Connect apps, see [Developing Connect Apps for Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-develop-connect-apps).

> [!TIP]  
> For inspiration and examples, see the open source [ALAppExtensions](https://github.com/microsoft/ALAppExtensions/tree/main/Apps/W1/APIV2/app/src/pages) repo. Here you'll find examples of API pages written in AL.
