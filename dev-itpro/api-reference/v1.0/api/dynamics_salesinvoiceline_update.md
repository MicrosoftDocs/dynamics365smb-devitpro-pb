# Update salesInvoiceLines (v1.0)
Update the properties of a sales invoice line object for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../../includes/prod_short.md)].

## HTTP request
Replace the URL prefix for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../../includes/prod_short.md)] depending on environment following the [guideline](../../v1.0/endpoints-apis-for-dynamics.md).

```
PATCH businesscentralPrefix/companies({id})/salesInvoices({id})/salesInvoiceLines({salesInvoiceLineId})
```

## Request headers

|Header|Value|
|------|-----|
|Authorization |Bearer {token}. Required.|
|Content-Type  |application/json|
|If-Match      |Required. When this request header is included and the eTag provided does not match the current tag on the **salesInvoiceLines**, the **salesInvoiceLines** will not be updated. |

## Request body

Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance you shouldn't include existing values that haven't changed.
