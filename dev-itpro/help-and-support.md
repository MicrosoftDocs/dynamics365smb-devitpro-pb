As a [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] partner, you have access to resources that can help you support your [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] customers, and you have access to resources that can help you be more productive as a partner.  

This page outlines the resources available to you.  

## Product Help

The functionality in the default version of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] is described on the Docs.microsoft.com site as described in the following table.  

> [!div class="mx-tdCol2BreakAll"]
> |Name  |Location  |Description|
> |---------|---------|---------|
> |Business functionality docs|[/dynamics365/business-central](/dynamics365/business-central/) |Use this library to learn about business functionality. |
> |Development and administration docs|[/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/)|Use this content to learn how to extend, customize, and administrate [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)].|

### AL developer documentation

In the [Development in AL](developer/devenv-dev-overview.md) section, you find descriptions of processes such as [compilation](developer/devenv-compilation-scope-overview.md) and [debugging](developer/devenv-debugging.md), and conceptual information about object types such as [tables](developer/devenv-tables-overview.md) and [events](developer/devenv-events-in-al.md).  

The reference documentation of the AL language publishes under the [AL Programming](developer/devenv-programming-in-al.md) umbrella. This content is partly generated automatically from code, but currently most of the reference content is maintained by hand. Use the following landing pages to quickly find the reference content that you need:

* Objects
    * [Table object](developer/devenv-table-object.md)
    * [Table extension object](developer/devenv-table-ext-object.md)

    * [Page extension object](developer/devenv-page-ext-object.md)
    * [Page customization object](developer/devenv-page-customization-object.md)
    * [Report object](developer/devenv-report-object.md)

### Product versions and Help versions

In general, the [!INCLUDE [prodshort](developer/includes/prodshort.md)] content on the Docs.microsoft.com site reflects the latest version of [!INCLUDE [prodshort](developer/includes/prodshort.md)] online with limited support for earlier versions.  

If you support [!INCLUDE [prodshort](developer/includes/prodshort.md)] on-premises, your solution might be one or two versions older than the latest version. This means that the content in the [business functionality docs](/dynamics365/business-central/) might describe functionality that your users do not have access to. For a better experience, we recommend that you take a copy of our content at the time when that reflected the version that your on-premises solution is based on and deploy that to your own website. For more information, see the [On-premises deployments](deployment/configure-help.md#on-premises-deployments) section in the [Configure the Help Experience](deployment/configure-help.md) article.

### Customize and extend the user assistance

When a prospect signs up for a trial of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] online, or before they buy [!INCLUDE [prodshort](developer/includes/prodshort.md)] on-premises, they have access to tooltips that can help them get unblocked, and context-sensitive links to learn more according to the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] user assistance model. If you customize or extend [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)], you are expected to also customize the user assistance so that users will have access to content that can help them get started, get unblocked, and learn more. For more information, see [User Assistance Model](user-assistance.md) and [Configure the Help Experience](deployment/configure-help.md).  

## Support

As a [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] reselling partner, you are an administrator of your customers' [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] tenants, and you are the first line of support. You can customize the support experience, and you have access to information that can help you troubleshoot any issues that your customers report.  

For more information, see [Technical Support](technical-support.md).  

## Training

You and your customers can find free eLearning content on the Microsoft Learn site. Find the related learning paths at [aka.ms/bclearn](https://aka.ms/bclearn).  

## Resources

As a partner, you can keep on top of current and upcoming capabilities, and you can share Microsoft's roadmap with your prospects, for example. This section provides links to places to keep track of for people who are new to [!INCLUDE [prodshort](developer/includes/prodshort.md)] as well as for people who have been working with the product for years.  

### Get set up as a partner

If you are not already a Microsoft partner, your company must get set up, and so must you as an employee. For more information, see [Take prospects and customers online](deployment/Deployment.md#take-prospects-and-customers-online).  

### Get started with the "Ready to Go" program
