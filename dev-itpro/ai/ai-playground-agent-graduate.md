# Graduate an AI Playground Agent (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

[!INCLUDE [ai-playground-preview](../includes/ai-playground-preview.md)]

SDK developers can graduate an AI Playground Agent to a production-ready Copilot feature by converting the agent's instructions, tasks, and permissions into an AL extension. This process involves translating the prototyped functionality into code that can be deployed in a production environment.
