Your company must be registered as a Microsoft partner, and it must have the *Advanced Support for Partners* (ASfP) or *Premier* [support plan](https://partner.microsoft.com/support/partnersupport). Your service account manager can get you more information about getting the ASfP. If you already have a support plan, the [Technical Benefits](/partner-center/mpn-benefits-technical-support) tab in the Partner Center lists the *contract ID* and *access ID* that you must specify when you submit a new support request on behalf of your customer. If you're not sure how to find the information, the service account manager can get the information for you.
