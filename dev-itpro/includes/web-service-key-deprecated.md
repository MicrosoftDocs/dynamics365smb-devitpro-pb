> Starting April, 2022, the use of access keys (Basic Auth) for web service authentication is [deprecated and not supported](../upgrade/deprecated-features-platform.md#accesskeys) in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online. We recommend that you use OAuth2 instead. For more information, see [Using OAuth to Authorize Business Central Web Services](../webservices/authenticate-web-services-using-oauth.md).
