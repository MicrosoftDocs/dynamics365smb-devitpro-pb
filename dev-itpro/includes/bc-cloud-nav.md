If you are currently on a version of Dynamics NAV, you must upgrade to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] on-premises, and then switch to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] online. For more information, see [Upgrading from Dynamics NAV to Business Central online](../upgrade/upgrade-considerations.md#online).
