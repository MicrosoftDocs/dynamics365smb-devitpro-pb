Deprecated features won't be available in future versions of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)], and they are deprecated for different kinds of reasons. For example, a feature may no longer be relevant, or something better may have become available. If you use a feature that is listed, either the feature itself or an extension of it, you should look for or develop an alternative.  

The next sections give a brief description of the deprecated features, state what happened to the feature, and explain why. The following table gives a few examples of what we mean by *moved*, *removed*, or *replaced*.  

| **State** |**Examples** |
|-----------|-------------|
| Moved     | The capability has been moved from local functionality to W1 because it was no longer specific to one or more country versions. The capability was combined with other related functionality to eliminate redundancy. |
| Removed   | The capability will be removed in a coming release. |
| Replaced  | Something better has become available, and will be used instead. |

This information will change with future releases, and might not include each deprecated feature.
