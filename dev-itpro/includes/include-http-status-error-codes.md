When you call a web service endpoint, either a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] API or from AL using Httpclient datatype, you get a HTTP status code as part of the response. All HTTP status codes that start with 4 (sometimes also written 4xx) are classified as client errors and it is your resposibility to react on these and fix the error in your code. 

In the following table, we list some common 4xx HTTP status codes and suggestions to how to fix them:

|HTTP status code| Short name | Description | Suggested solution(s) | 
|----------------|-------------|-----------------------|
|400|Bad Request|This indicates that the server cannot or will not process the request due to an error on the client side e.g. malformed request syntax, header too long, or something else. | The client need to fix things on their end. <br>For an incoming call of category OData/API, consider using telemetry to find the error. You can also setup a debugger and debug the endpoint code. <br>For an outgoing call, you need to review/debug the AL code that sends the request. |
|401|Access denied|The request failed because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource. | <br>For an incoming call, this is an authorization issue on the Business Central end of this, either in the OnOpenCompany trigger or a permission issue. <br>For an outgoing call, you need to examine the AL code that sets up certificates or sets authorization header(s).|
|402|Payment Required| Indicates that the caller must make a payment to access the requested resource. Typically used in situations where the server requires payment before granting access to the content or service. | <br>This status code is not returned by the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] server for incoming calls.
<br>For an outgoing call, you need to examine the AL code that calls the service and setup error handling to handle this situation. |
|403|Forbidden|This status code is returned when there is some kind of access restriction policy implemented for the requested resource. | <br>For an outgoing call, you need to examine the AL code that sets up certificates or sets authorization header(s). Or maybe your app should not call the specified endpoint at all. |
|404|Not found|The resource you are calling does not exist (anymore?)| <br>For an incoming call of category OData/API, this endpoint is not available in metadata. If the endpoint used to work, the issue might be due to uninstalling or updating an app/extension. For UI pages exposed as OData (please move to APIs!), check if the page was disabled by an administrator.  <br>For an outgoing call, you need to examine the URI specified in the AL code calling the endpoint and compare it with the endpoints available on the server you call.|
|405|Method not allowed| The HTTP verb used in the request is not allowed for the specific URI that an HTTP client requested. | <br>For an incoming call, you need to examine the HTTP method and compare that with what the endpoint supports. One example could be a client calling an API query (which is read-only) using HTTP POST. <br>For an outgoing call, you need to examine the AL code that calls out and compare the Httpclient method used with what the external service offers. |
|408|Request timed out|This is returned when the server didn't receive a complete request message within the time that it was prepared to wait. | <br>For an incoming call, this is returned by the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] server when the request fails to complete within the limits setup in the server configuration. For online environments, the limits are documented here: [Operational Limits for Business Central Online](../administration/operational-limits-online.md). For on-premises environments, you might be able to adjust the server limits to allow more time for requests to complete. For on-premises environments, you need to change the AL code for the endpoint or call break up the request into multiple requests to make them fit within the time limits. <br>For an outgoing call, you need to investigate the similar limits setup for the external service. Then either change your AL code or break up the request into multiple requests to make them fit within the time limits. |
|409|Conflict|Indicates that the request could not be processed because of conflict in the current state of the resource, such as an edit conflict between multiple simultaneous updates.| <br>For an incoming call, this happens when another user has already changed the record(s) that the request is trying to modify. <br>For an outgoing call, you need to look into the documentation for the service you are calling.|
|410|Gone| Indicates that the resource requested was previously in use but is no longer available and will not be available again. | Check you client code/configuration and stop calling this endpoint. |
|412|Precondition Failed|The server does not meet one of the preconditions that the requester put on the request header fields.|You need to examine the code that calls the endpoint and check if the settings of request or content HTTP headers match what the service expects. <br>For an incoming call, check if you have supplied the required headers as specified in the API documentation, see [API (v2.0) for Business Central](../api-reference/v2.0/index.md) for details. <br>For an outgoing call, a common error is to forget to set the _Content-Type_ header (which by default is set to 'text/plain; charset=utf-8'. For more information about content headers, see [HttpContent Data Type](../developer/methods-auto/httpcontent/httpcontent-data-type.md).  )
|415|Unsupported Media Type|The request uses a media type which is not supported by the server/resource.  | Could very well be due to wrong Content-Type or Content-Encoding headers in the request.  |
|418|I'm a teapot|This HTTP status is exposed as an Easter egg in some services.| If you experience this, there is probably nothing else to do than have a nice cup of tea. Then get back to work afterwards refreshed and ready to fix some more HTTP issues. |
|429|Too Many Requests|This is returned when you call too aggresively to the server and it asks you to relax a bit.| The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] performance tuning guide explains how you can implement different retry strategies to deal with this type of issue. For more information, see [Performance Articles For Developers](../performance/performance-developer.md#how-to-handle-large-throughput-of-web-service-calls)|
