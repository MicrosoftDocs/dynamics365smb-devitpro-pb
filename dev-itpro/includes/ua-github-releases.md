Both the source repo, *dynamics365smb-docs*, and the translation repos, such as *dynamics365smb-docs-pr.de-de* and *dynamics365smb-docs-pr.it-it*, contain packages of MarkDown files for major versions and snapshots of the docs for the previous minor version. This is particularly useful if you deploy [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, since the repos by default reflect the latest version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online.  

For example, navigate to the equivalent of [https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/dynamics365smb-docs-pr.da-DK/releases](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/dynamics365smb-docs-pr.da-DK/releases), and then get the release that you need for your solution.
