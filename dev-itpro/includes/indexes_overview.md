Indexes are an effective feature in relational databases, like SQL, to speed up the process of finding data. By indexing your frequently needed data, the overall performance of your application is optimized. For example, when you need to see some information in your application, a database query will run behind the scene to complete your request and it will look up every record until it finds the required information. This process of finding information is time consuming and slows down the application performance. However, if you index the data, like those columns that are referred more often, the database will directly go to that column instead of looking up all records in the table. This will significantly increase the efficiency and overall performance of your application.
