You can also start the process from the Partner Center. Choose the customer you want to open a case on, and then follow the support request work flow. You're automatically redirected to the Power Platform admin center in the context of the customer's tenant.  

However, you might need information from the [!INCLUDE [prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)], which is why we recommend that route. For more information, see [Report problems on behalf of a customer](/partner-center/report-problems-on-behalf-of-a-customer) in the Partner Center content.
