# Performance Overview

The following sections help you understand and improve the performance of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)]. The content is centered around the different ways a functional consultant, a developer, or an administrator can make changes with a performance impact.

- Visit [Performance Tips for Business Users](performance-users.md) to learn more about tips on how you can work with end-users to improve the performance.
- Visit [How Application Configurations Affect Performance](performance-application.md) to learn about how in-product configurations affect performance.
- Visit [Performance Articles for Developers](performance-developer.md) to learn about how to code for performance in AL, and how to identify performance issues using the [Performance Toolkit](../developer/devenv-performance-toolkit.md) extension. The extension is available for free on [AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2148001). 
- Visit [Performance in Business Central Online](performance-online.md) to learn more about performance in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] service.
- Visit [Performance of Business Central On-Premises Installations](performance-onprem.md) to learn more about the various ways the different components in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] can be configured to achieve better performance for an on-premises installation.
