# Overview of AL-Go

AL-Go for GitHub contains a set of GitHub templates and actions that can be used to set up and maintain professional DevOps processes for your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] AL projects.

The goal is that people who have created their GitHub repositories based on the AL-Go templates, can maintain these repositories and stay current just by running a workflow, which updates their repositories. This maintenance includes necessary changes to scripts and workflows to cope with new features and functions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)].

The template repositories to use as starting point are:

- To create a **per-tenant extension**, here's your starting point
**[https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go-PTE](https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go-PTE)** is the GitHub repository template for per-tenant extensions.
- To create an **AppSource app**, here's your starting point
**[https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go-AppSource](https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go-AppSource)** is the GitHub repository template for AppSource apps. 

To get started with AL-Go, see [AL-Go for GitHub](https://freddysblog.com/2022/04/26/al-go-for-github/). All documentation for AL-Go for GitHub is maintained and updated in the repository. Go to [Al-Go for GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go/blob/main/README.md) to see the latest documentation.
