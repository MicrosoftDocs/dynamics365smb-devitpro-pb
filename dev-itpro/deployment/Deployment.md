# Deployment of [!INCLUDE[prod_long](../developer/includes/prod_long.md)]

The topics in the Deployment section are intended to help a partner prepare a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] solution for a customer online or on-premises.  

## Take prospects and customers online

You can give prospects a quick introduction to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] by asking them to get a [free trial](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=847861), and by showing them the apps in [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?page=1&product=dynamics-365%3Bdynamics-365-business-central), for example. You can also create and give powerful demos that will attract prospects in your market space. With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online, data is stored in the Microsoft cloud, removing the need to install SQL Server locally, for example. So for you as a reseller, deployments of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online are taken care of for you so that you can focus on your prospects and customers.  

### Get set up for selling Business Central online

If your organization has a background as resellers of [!INCLUDE [navnow_md](../developer/includes/navnow_md.md)] or other on-premises products, you have to get set up in the Microsoft Partner Center. For more information, see [Get Started as a Reseller of Business Central Online](../administration/get-started-online.md).

For more information about reseller readiness for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], see [Build Your Business on Dynamics 365 Business Central](../developer/readiness/readiness-welcome.md).  

### Give powerful demos

You can create a trial environment based on the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] content pack in [cdx.transform.microsoft.com](https://cdx.transform.microsoft.com/).  

For more information, see [Preparing Demonstration Environments of [!INCLUDE[prod_long](../developer/includes/prod_long.md)]](../administration/demo-environment.md).  

### Managing [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online

For more information about administering online tenants, see [Administration of Business Central Online](../administration/tenant-administration.md).  

## When to choose on-premises deployment

There can be many reasons to prefer to deploy [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises rather than using online deployments.  

### Key Features of Setup for On-Premises Deployments  

With [!INCLUDE[prodsetup](../developer/includes/prodsetup.md)], you can:  

- Install different components on different computers.  

- Choose from a selection of predefined installation options, or create your own custom list of components and options to install.  

- Preconfigure components before installation.  

- Create, save, or load setup configuration files that capture your selection of components and configuration information.  

 You use setup to install software and to create custom deployments that you can distribute to different users across a company.  

### Installation Notes  

- Before installing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] components on a computer, you must remove \(uninstall\) any previous versions.  

- All components must be from the same version and build of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] for the software to run correctly.  

- If you have either SQL Server 2000 or Microsoft SQL Server Desktop Engine \(MSDE\) installed on a computer where you want to install [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], then you must remove it before you begin installing. The presence of either of these database products causes a setup error.  

### Managing [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises

For more information about administering on-premises deployments, see [Administration of Business Central On-Premises](../administration/Administration.md).  

## Configuring the Help Experience

Part of your configuration is to specify where to look up the Help for the solution. For on-premises deployments, you can choose to install the legacy Help Server, for example. For more information, see [Configuring the Help Experience](configure-help.md).
