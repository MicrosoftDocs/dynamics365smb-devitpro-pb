Agents surface Business Central data (customers, orders, invoices, inventory) and business logic to users via natural language, automate tasks like creating sales orders, checking credit, or posting payments, and trigger approvals or flows.

Agents can use model‑aware tools like the Dynamics 365 Business Central MCP server or connector to read and write records, call custom APIs from AL extensions, while respecting pricing, discount, and validation rules server‑side. You can publish agents into the following targets:

- **Teams**
- **Dynamics 365**
- **Microsoft 365 apps**
- **Power Apps/Pages**
- **Custom web channels**

Governance (including Entra ID authentication, data loss prevention, and environment policies) ensures secure, auditable access.
