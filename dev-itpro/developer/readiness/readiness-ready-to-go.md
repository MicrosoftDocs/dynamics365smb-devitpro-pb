An example of one of the coaching sessions provided by the Development Centers and Master VARs are **the “Ready to Go” validation workshops**. This workshop is an 8h workshop at a fixed price which is designed to coach you in bringing your app into Microsoft AppSource or help you with the implementation of your first customer.
