# Ready to Go
The **Ready to Go** program contains a set of resources, services and tools which enables you to provide your offerings on Microsoft [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] and Microsoft Appsource.     

It holds the following three core elements:

1. The Ready to Go online learning
2. The Ready to Go trainings and workshops provided by Development Centers and Master VARs
3. The Ready to Go platform

## The Ready to Go online learning
An extensive resource library hosted on the **Dynamics Learning Portal**. It contains readiness information for marketers, business decision makers, Architects and developers. The content addresses the needs of both reselling partners of [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] as App builders who want to provide Apps on Microsoft AppSource. 

You can find the **Ready to Go Online Training Catalog** at the Dynamics Learning Portal: http://aka.ms/ReadyToGoOnlineLearning. 

## The Ready to Go trainings and workshops provided by Development Centers and Master VARs
The Microsoft Development Centers and Master VARs provide technical service offerings and have industry specific knowledge that you can contract and leverage when developing your App. These companies are independently owned and operated.  There is a worldwide presence of development centers and are therefore always within reach to assist you. Over time, they have built up a strong knowledge base and a set of highly developed best practices that you can lean on when developing your apps. When contracting an Development Center, you get solid and well-founded assistance in creating offerings for [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] and Microsoft AppSource.

Development Centers have strong ties with Microsoft’s R&D teams, as well as are an incremental part of our early Engagement programs. The **Ready to Go Validation Workshop** is a packaged offering, brought to market by all development centers and Master VARs and is co-developed with Microsoft.
