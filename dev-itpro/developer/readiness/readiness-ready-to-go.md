# Ready to Go
The **"Ready to Go"** program is designed to support you in bringing your Microsoft [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)] offers into Microsoft Appsource. The program holds the following three core elements:

- The "Ready to Go" online learning
- The "Ready to Go" coaching
- The "Ready to Go" platform

## The "Ready to Go" online learning
The "Ready to Go" online learning catalog is an extensive 
library of training materials, hosted on the **Dynamics Learning Portal**. You can find the "Ready to Go" online learning catalog [here](http://aka.ms/ReadyToGoOnlineLearning).  

This catalog contains readiness information for marketers, business decision makers, architects, and developers. The content addresses the needs of both reselling partners of [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)] as App builders who want to provide Apps on Microsoft AppSource.

> [!NOTE]
> *We recommend you bookmark the "Ready to Go" online learning catalog. New materials will appear in the catalog on a weekly base.*

## The "Ready to Go" coaching
The "Ready to Go" coaching is executed by Microsoft Development Centers and Master VARs, which are independently owned and operated. They bring technical services and coaching to market and have industry specific knowledge that you can contract and leverage when developing your offerings. Over time they have developed lots of best practices by supporting multiple partners, they also have strong ties with Microsoft’s R&D teams and are always up to date on the latest strategy and product innovation.

The "Ready to Go" validation workshop is offered by all Development Centers and Master VARs at fixed price and is designed to coach you in bringing your [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)] offerings to market faster and with less friction by providing individual coaching. This 8-hour workshop helps partners make the right decisions and is based upon a unified checklist and set of training materials.
