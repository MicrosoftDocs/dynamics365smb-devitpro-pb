# Marketing Validation Checklist

The storefront details on AppSource is the first impression that prospects get regarding your offer. First impressions last, so make sure to invest some time
in developing the content on the storefront, so it gives a good impression from the beginning. Failing to do so will jeopardize the hard work you put in, when
developing your offer, likely leaving the prospect confused or looking elsewhere. Accordingly, we recommend you put in the time, effort and due diligence when developing this content.

You use Partner Center to submit your offer to AppSource. In the following, you can find information on all the marketing-related items that you need to fill out in Partner Center prior to submitting your app to AppSource. Follow this marketing validation checklist and get your app passed on the first submission.
