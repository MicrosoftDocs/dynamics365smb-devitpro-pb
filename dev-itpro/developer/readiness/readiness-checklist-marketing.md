# Marketing Validation Checklist

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> In these guidelines, you will find an outline of our requirements for marketing validation as well as examples of best practices, which you can use as inspiration, while developing the storefront
details of your offer, your sales landing page and video materials. 

To ease your experience with developing the storefront details of your listing, we have numerated the core elements, as they appear when you upload your content in the “Storefront Details” tab in Partner Center. 

This image below is an example of what an offering looks like on AppSource, when the storefront details are completed according to best practices. We highly recommend that you review these guidelines.  Click on any of the links under Guidance/Examples to gain more insight on that particular section or item within the marketing validation process.

## Marketing Checklist for Showcasing Your App

The storefront details on AppSource is the first impression that prospects get
regarding your offer. First impressions last, so make sure to invest some time
in developing the content on the storefront, so it gives a good impression from
the beginning. Failing to do so will jeopardize the hard work you put in, when
developing your offer, likely leaving the prospect confused or looking
elsewhere. Accordingly, we recommend you put in the time, effort and due
diligence when developing this content. Follow this marketing validation checklist and get your app passed on the first submission. 

## Why marketing validation is mandatory

The marketing validation is in place to make sure that the customer journey on AppSource is a uniform experience, where customers quickly and easily can get an overview of your offer’s functionality, why they can benefit from using it, while also enticing them to learn more and take the necessary actions to start using your offer. Accordingly, to ensure that your listing establishes a good first impression, we carry out a marketing validation of all Dynamics 365 Business Central apps that are being published on AppSource. This also goes for apps that already are live, if some of the content in their storefront details needs to be edited – in this case they need to be resubmitted for marketing validation as well.
Consequently, to be published on AppSource all listings need to pass the required elements within the marketing validation process.
