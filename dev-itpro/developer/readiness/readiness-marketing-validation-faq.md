# Marketing Validation FAQ
 

## Where do I state the countries, editions and languages that my offer supports?  
You are required to state the countries, editions and languages that your offer supports in the very bottom of your offer’s description text. You can use the following format:  
**Supported Editions:**  
    The app supports the Essentials and Premium Editions of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.  
**Supported Countries:**  
    Canada, Mexico and United States  
**Supported Languages:**
    This app is available in English (United States) and Spanish (Mexico). 
 
## Do you have any tips and tricks for what I should write in the description text?  

Yes. We have detailed guidelines and good advice about that [here](readiness-checklist-c-offer-description.md).  

## How do I refer correctly to the product?  

When you mention the product, both throughout your description text, as well as in your marketing material, you need to refer to the product, in the following way:  
 
**First mentions:** Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central  
 
**Secondary mentions:** Dynamics 365 Business Central  
 
**Subsequent mentions:** [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../includes/prodshort.md)] 
 
Therefore, you cannot use any abbreviations such as “MS Dyn 365 BC” or “Microsoft Dynamics NAV”. 
 
## What are the requirements for my offer’s help and support page?

You are required to submit two distinct pages for support and help i.e. they cannot be the same. You can see what you have to include on both pages in the table below.  

|Help|Support|
|----|-------|
|Learning material such as FAQs, step by step guides, video tutorials, webinars etc.|At least two contact options (e.g. e-mail, phone, chat) and a defined SLA for how much time it takes before you answer to support inquires.|

## Can I use the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central logo?  

No, you cannot use the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../includes/prodshort.md)] logo, as it’s a Microsoft trademarked logo. However, you can use the “Get it from Microsoft AppSource” badge, which you can find [here](https://appsource.microsoft.com/blogs/new-get-it-from-badging-for-microsoft-appsource-and-azure-marketplace-available-in-the-marketing-resources-guide).
