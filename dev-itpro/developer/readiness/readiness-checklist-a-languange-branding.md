# Language, Branding, and Microsoft Images

## Language
Your app can be in any language; if not in English, a document with English translation is required. See in the list below what to consider for each storefront detail when it comes to language: 

|Description | Requirements |
|------------|---------------|
|Offer name:| Can be in any language |
|Summary:| Can be in any one language (not more because of length constraints).|
|Description:| Can be in multiple languages (max 3) but must be the same content for each language. If English is not one of the languages chosen, an English document must be added.|
|Screenshots:| Can be in any language|
|Videos:|Can be in any language, no captioning required, however English captioning recommended|
|Documents:| If description is not in English, a supporting document with description in English is required.|
|Keywords:| Can be in any language.|
|Support / Help:| Can be in any language. Recommended in English. |
|Privacy:| If hosted on partner website, can be any language.|
|Licensing:| Must be in English if hosted on AppSource, can be in any language if hosted on partner website.|
|Supported countries:| Must be in English.|
|Supported editions:| Must be in English.|
|Supported languages:| Must be in English.|

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are targeting an international audience, we  recommend you use English on AppSource.

## Branding

 Be consistent with branding throughout your communications. All references (spoken and written in videos, docs, app landing page, screenshots, title bars etc.) must refer to the correct branding i.e. either **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central**, **Dynamics 365 Business Central**, or **Business Central**. 


Make sure to make the right reference throughout your content:
- Based on the "new" branding guidelines, the full name, "**Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central**" must be used in its entirety at first mention on the page, and at all prominent locations such as titles, headings etc. (unless the Microsoft brand is already clearly established)
- **Dynamics 365 Business Central** on second mention (or first mention if the Microsoft brand is already clearly established)
- **Business Central** on subsequent mention as long as Microsoft Dynamics 365 has been clearly established on that given page or content. 

> [!NOTE]  
> Don't make any references to acronyms (such as D365, BC, or MSDYN365BC) or old brand names such as ("for financials" or "for Finance & Operations").


## Microsoft images 
- You can include the [AppSource badge](https://appsource.microsoft.com/blogs/new-get-it-from-badging-for-microsoft-appsource-and-azure-marketplace-available-in-the-marketing-resources-guide) in your marketing material. 
- Besides the AppSource badge, don’t include any Microsoft logos or icons (such as the Business Central icon or Dynamics 365 logo) in your offer.
