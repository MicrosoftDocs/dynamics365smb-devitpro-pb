# How to Make Compelling Videos

Why use video? It is well worth investing time and resources to create marketing videos for your app, it is taken seriously in a business environment.

## Reasons why video is a superior medium

- Videos offers a very rich, stimulating communication medium that engages multiple senses.
- Video engages the mind and triggers emotions, which makes it more compelling than text-based content.
- Our brains have an easier time processing visual stories than bullet points or straight facts.

A recent Demand Gen survey indicated that 58% of B2B buyers consume video content, while Hyperfine media states that 59% of executives would rather watch video than read text. Also, 50% of executives look for more information after seeing a product/service in a video.

## Speak to Specific Personas in your videos

You should create a video for each of the three core personas in the company:

- WHY persona: Owner/executive/leadership
- HOW: Business line manager
- WHAT: IT buyer, User

A horizontal generic message that attempts to speak to everyone will likely not reach anyone in an emotionally engaging way. Wasting a prospect’s time by requiring him/her to listen to irrelevant data or information will only create frustration and lead him/her to form a negative bias towards your company.

## Choose the video format that is relevant for the audience that you want to target

## **Video type 1**: “Why” video	

**How to set up “Why” videos**

- Recommended length: 60-90 seconds 
- Purpose: 
    - Your video should clearly communicate WHY prospects need to buy your solution now.
- Focus: 
    - Make sure the prospect is the hero of the story, not you or your company. Prospects are not interested in hearing about your company at this stage. They are simply trying to determine if what you offer is of value to THEM. 
    - Your video should speak to the principal challenges and goals of your core decision-maker persona.
    - Describe the desired end state they will achieve by using your app.
    - A client/customer speaking about the benefits they received from your app is far more credible and compelling than anyone from your organization.
        - Don’t only rely on “features” to acquire new customers.

**How to speak to a WHY persona in a video**

- Target audience: 
    - Owner/executive/leadership 
    - They have limited time and financial resources as well as many competing priorities and resource requirements
    - You need to elevate the discussion to a strategic level, where you highlight market share, competitiveness, profitability, differentiation, revenue loss, and more.
- Message: 
    - The question you must answer beyond a doubt is WHY should they invest the time and money to buy your app? What will they get out of it?
    - Why should they spend money on a new system now? Can’t they put it off?
    - The WHY messaging teaches people something and it is industry specific and results oriented, as well as being memorable. It engages the emotional/limbic brain and leads to meaningful action.

## **Video type 2**: “How & What” video	

**How to set up “How and What product videos”**

- Recommended length: Up to 3 minutes.

- Purpose: 
    - This video goes into greater depth communicating the main benefits of your app as well as HOW you solve your prospects’ problems. You can include some WHAT content.
•	Focus: 
    - Demonstrating the proof of your claims is critical during this video.
    - Show very specific dashboards or visually show how you address prospect challenges.
    - If possible, use contrast to create desire and a sense of urgency. For example, you could show a complex, ugly data-filled forecast spreadsheet next to a beautiful visual dashboard stating “your sales forecast before and after.”

**How to speak to a HOW persona: (Business line manager)**

- Target audience: Business Line Manager 
    - HOW focuses on the operational benefits your solution will provide and HOW your organization will support the implementation.
    - Speaking to the HOW persona starts to separate you from the pack.
•	Message: o HOW content is VISUAL in nature and ACTION oriented. It allows your prospects to identify with you at a FUNCTIONAL business level and to Add-on with you. It provides evidence that your organization has relevant industry experience. Tribal acceptance increases, while risk decreases.
    - HOW messaging begins to appeal to the limbic brain because it is focused primarily on emotional business pains and problems.

**How to speak to a WHAT persona: (IT buyer, User)**

- Target audience: IT-buyer, User 
    - WHAT people are often tasked with finding a solution and are important influencers in the decision, but they are not the financial decision makers, and their opinions are easily overturned by HOW and WHY people in the organization. 
    - Therefore, don’t invest all of your marketing time, money, and effort into providing content just for them.
- Message: 
    - You need to survive the WHAT inquisition and provide information about product-related features, functionality, and data so that prospects clearly understand your solution offering.
    - However, this will seldom trigger an emotional response and, therefore, it is likely there will be little or no emotional engagement with your content.
    - WHAT content is binary. WHAT content is a commodity. WHAT content is boring. Logical WHAT content is a necessary evil because many prospects initially go looking for it, but stopping here means remaining relevant only to WHAT personas.

## **Video type 3: “Getting started” video**

**How to set up “Getting started videos”**

- Recommended length: 2–3 minutes maximum.
- Purpose: This video should prove it is quick and easy to get up and running with your app.
- Target: What personas (Users, It buyers)

## **Video type 4: “Customer testimony” video**

**How to set up “Customer testimonial videos”** - Recommended length: Up to 2 minutes

- Purpose: 
    - Social reinforcement: Customer stories are the best proof of gain.
- Focus: 
    - A story coming directly from your client in the form of a testimonial is stronger than having your prospects take your word for it. If prospects see that other similar people orcompanies have already purchased your solution, then their natural response will be to more readily accept it as a solution for themselves.

## **Video tips**

How to structure your video and practical things to keep in mind when producing videos
	
**How to structure the flow in your video?**

- Gain immediate attention in the first 10 seconds of the video
Stimulate curiosity by include a hook phrase/comment that will elude to solving a pain point. Ask questions about the prospects’ core business challenges or ask about something they would like to do but can’t accomplish today.
- Highlight the prospects’ problems:
Use an empathetic approach when describing their current situation and demonstrate that you understand their current business challenges. They must relate to this if they are to continue watching.
- Give them new learning
Teach them something they don’t know. Demonstrate you have expertise and knowledge about their business or industry that they might not. Show you can offer strategic value to them.
- Paint a picture of a desired outcome they would love to have or state they crave to experience
Highlight the benefits, rewards, and value they will enjoy after they purchase from you. Include both what it looks like and how it will feel.
- Prove what you’re saying is true
Prospects don’t trust us when we say our products are great. Include objective and credible proof in the form of data, charts, graphs, quotes, statistics, or testimonials as evidence of your claims.
- Ask them to take action
Include a call to action at the end of all videos. When viewers watch your videos, they should feel inspired to take the next step towards purchasing. Tell them what to do next and include an interactive link to the next step in the buying cycle. Use scarcity to compel them to action. Provide a timelimited offer or, for example, say it is “only for the first 20 customers”.

**Practical things to keep in mind when producing and distributing your video**

Does and don’t when producing your video

- Don’t make the video too long
As our attention span is 8 seconds the ideal length of video is 90 seconds (minimum 30 seconds/maximum 2 minutes).
- Add interactivity where possible
Overlay text, charts, animation, questions etc. Visually call out key messages.
- Make sure your audio is high quality.
- Make your video easily shareable
- Enable your video to be shared on multiple media. Track views and attention span. Observe and measure viewer patterns so that you can learn from prospects’ actual behaviors and then improve future content.

**How to make a good narrative that speak to the right persona in the right way?**

- Your narrative should have a beginning, middle, and end.
    - Lead with a story, not with your app or the technology. 
    - Don’t turn your videos into a product pitch.
    - You’ll build more brand affinity and trust by shedding light on a problem your prospects care about rather than by pitching your solutions to them directly.
- The brain is on alert at the beginning of the video and at the end.
    - Make sure the first and last ten seconds are compelling, memorable, and interesting.
- Speak directly to a particular persona in the second person.
    - Do not talk about them in the third person, and avoid using terms like “our clients” and “companies”; instead, use “you” language as often as possible.
    - Use a lot of industry specific vocabulary, terminology, and visuals. If possible, film onsite at a customer’s location rather than in your office or in a studio.
- Speak to a particular persona:
    - Do not try to appeal to everyone at once, as you may not fully engage anyone with this approach.
    - Keep your delivery casual and authentic to instill trust. Speak directly to the prospect as if you were having a fireside chat
    - The prospect should be the hero of the story, i.e. do not speak about you and your company.
- Ask rhetorical questions that stimulate pain and anxiety in your prospects in order to demonstrate that you understand their business problems.
    - For example: Are your margins decreasing? Having cash flow problems because you can’t collect payments sooner than 90 days? Had another large write off? Lost an important customer recently due to a late delivery?
- Use visual and auditory language to help the prospect imagine a new possible future.
    - For example: “imagine seeing” , “picture yourself”, or “ how would you like to hear your clients say…” and so on.
- Use contrast whenever possible.
    - Compare prospects’ experience now versus what it could be after the implementation of your solution.
    - Call out your competitive differentiators while anchoring your solution in prospects’ minds so that they can compare all others against the bar you set.

**How to make a good narrative that speak to the right persona in the right way?**

- Where possible, use tangible, concrete language.
    - Include quantifiable proof in the form of data or visual pictures.
    - No vague claims like “transform your business with the cloud”. This is an emotionless statement.
- Providing customer references and testimonials is much more compelling and effective than selling your company or product yourself.
    - Let others speak for you. A customer testimonial video will always be more believable and compelling than a video of you saying the same thing.
- Surprise and delight them.
    - Use humor to make them smile. We take ourselves and our problems too seriously. Be warm, memorable, and unique.
