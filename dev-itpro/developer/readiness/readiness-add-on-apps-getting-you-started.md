# Getting You Started with Building Apps

## Build your business on Dynamics 365 Business Central

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central is a business management solution that helps companies connect their financials, sales, service and operations to streamline business processes, improve customer interactions and make better decisions. With this modern business platform, you can easily and quickly tailor, extend and build applications so they fit your specific needs — with little to no code development.

AppSource is Microsoft's marketplace for your Dynamics 365 Business Central offerings and there are several reasons why going to market with Microsoft AppSource is a great idea. For example, it allows you to promote your brand, expand your reach, accelerate the customer journey and upsell your solutions and it connects you with millions of Microsoft 365 & Dynamics 365 business users. Find more information about which opportunities you have as a partner at: Apps on AppSource for Business Central [aka.ms/BusinessCentralApps](https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralApps).

You can bring two types of offerings to Microsoft AppSource:
- **Add-on Apps** (that brings your industry expertise to market), **Connect Apps** (that connect services) and **Embed Apps** (an end-to-end solution meeting the specific needs of a vertical or micro-vertical industry). [What is an Embed App?](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/embed-app-overview)
- Or **Packaged Consulting Services** (that bring ready-made packaged engagements to market).

## Guidelines for Business Central Add-on apps

To ease your journey, from the initial listing to the final publication of your **Add-on app** on AppSource, we have created two whitepapers that outlines 4 consecutive steps that you need to go through. To bring your Business Central offers to AppSource smoothly, we recommend that you check off each step as you progress. We highly recommend that you lean on the guidelines in these whitepapers to support you throughout the process of bringing your app to AppSource:
    
**Getting you started with Add-on Apps** 
- STEP 1: Create and set up your accounts

**Developing and publishing your Add-on App to AppSource**
- STEP 2: Develop your app
- STEP 3: Initiate the validation and publication process

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Please review all of the steps and follow the [Marketing Validation Checklist](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/readiness/readiness-checklist-marketing) and [Technical Validation Checklist](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-checklist-submission). 

## STEP 1: Create and set up your accounts

**MPN ID**

All App builders and app publishers must be identifiable to Microsoft. For this reason, you need to become a member of Microsoft's Partner Network (MPN) – this will of course be off no cost to you.
- [Sign up to become a member of our Partner network here:](https://partners.microsoft.com/PartnerProgram/simplifiedenrollment.aspx)

**PartnerSource Business Center (PSBC) account and your unique license file**

*Register as a Partner*

Developing an Add-on app requires you to be known as Dynamics 365 Business Central developer and requires you to have a unique development license file with a specific object range.

To obtain an object range for developing a Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, you must first have access to [**PartnerSource Business Center (PSBC)**](https://businesscenter.mbs.microsoft.com/#)

Access to PSBC is provided by having an active:
- Solution Provider Agreement (SPA) if you are a reselling partner using the Dynamics Pricelist
- Partner Registration Agreement (PRA) if you are a non-selling partner.

The relevant contract can be requested through your local Regional Operations Center (ROC) Contracts and Agreements Team below:
- [mbscon@microsoft.com](mailto:mbscon@microsoft.com): If you are based in Europe, the Middle East, or Africa.
- [mbsagree@microsoft.com](mailto:mbsagree@microsoft.com): If you are based in the Americas.
- [mbslques@microsoft.com](mailto:mbslques@microsoft.com): If you are based in the Asia Pacific region.

## Object Ranges

When you develop a Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central App for Microsoft AppSource, you will need to request access to an object range which holds a certain number of objects with which you can build your solution.   In order to avoid overlap between objects used in different solution,each partner is assigned a number of objects in a unique object range. For example, a partner could get assigned the object range 70,001,000 – 70,001,999 which will give them 1000 numbered objects which they can use to develop Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central solutions.

*Requesting the correct license file and object range*

Depending on where you will deploy your Dynamics 365 Business Central solution (cf. on premise or in the Cloud) you can use different licensing methods and object ranges. 
There are currently 2 available ranges which you can request.  Both have some characteristics which you need to keep in mind:
-    The **RSP Object Range (1-69 million)**:  This object range is tied to [the RSP Program details](https://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/northamerica/partner-essentials/agreements-guides-and-handbooks/RegisterSolutionProgram).  The program details specify that you have to pay quarterly for used objects. However, if you comply with the [Certified for Microsoft Dynamics (CFMD)](https://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/global/partner-essentials/partner-programs/certified-for-microsoft-dynamics/process/CfMD_Process) program requirements, one of the benefits of the program is that the quarterly fees on object costs will be waived. This object range can both be implemented on-premises, partner hosted (in C/AL or AL format) or in the Business Central SAAS  Service (AL Only format).   The RSP Program page describes the process on how to request the RSP object range.
-    The **App Object Range (70-75 million)**: 
This object range was originally designed to run in the Business Central service only for Microsoft Appsource Apps.  
Today you can implement apps developed in this range both on-premises, partner hosted and in the Business Central SaaS Service.
This object range is free of charge, the only requirement on this range is that your objects can be AL only.   
You can request both object ranges [here](https://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/global/partner-essentials/partner-strategy/365businesscentralrequestuniqueobjectrange).

You will have to make a choice which object range is best for you. Some partners desire to have 1 product line which can be implemented everywhere, others want to build a new SaaSified app separate from their legacy solutions.


## Developer account
A developer account enables you to submit apps and add-ins to Microsoft's marketplaces, including the Windows Store, Office Store, Azure Marketplace, and Microsoft AppSource.
Note, you only need one developer account per company (not one per app submission).
- Register (or check if you already have access) [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/store/register)
- A one-time registration fee applies

*Choosing a primary contact email and publisher display name*

When registering for a Microsoft Developer Account you will be asked to provide an **E-mail address** and a **Publisher display name**. When choosing your display name and primary email account, please take the following into account:
- Email: To ease submission and avoid missing vital communications we recommend you provide a companywide email/dev center account that can be shared across multiple users so that several people can manage your portal submission.

*Although, if you prefer a singular account, where you can add multiple users through the portal, then this is possible too.*

Publisher Display name: A display name refers to how you want your company name displayed on your app in **Microsoft AppSource**.

See example to the right, where the display name is highlighted in yellow.

Consistency is key!

It is key that you use the same display name and email throughout your app submission, as you will be asked to provide them in several different touch points. such as for example:

- To sign into Partner Center (and creating your app offer)
- To enroll and sign in to the Collaborate tool and "Ready to Go" platform

## Access to Partner Center

Partner Center is the single destination to manage your business relationship with Microsoft. [Get Started by clicking this link](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/enrollment/introduction/azureisv)

> [!NOTE]  
> This has replaced Partner Source. All AppSource apps have been migrated to Partner Center and you need to utilize Partner Center going forward.

## Get onboarded to tools and programs

### Create your sandbox environment

You have 3 options to work develop against the current version of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.
- If your add-on is lightweight, it might be sufficient to use a [sandbox environment](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-get-started).
- If you want to setup a Docker-based development environment on Azure, you can use [Business Central Azure Sandbox](https://aka.ms/BCSandboxAzure).
- If you want to setup a local Docker-based developer environment, you can download a PowerShell script available [here](https://aka.ms/BCSandboxLocal).

## The "Ready to Go" program

There are several things to keep in mind in building an Add-on app. The **"Ready to Go" program** is designed to support you in bringing your Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central offers into Microsoft Appsource. The program encompasses the following three core support options that you can leverage:
- Element 1: ["Ready to Go" Online learning](/dynamics365/business-central/readiness/readiness-learning-catalog?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/toc.json)
- Element 2: ["Ready to Go" Coaching](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/readiness/readiness-ready-to-go?tabs=coaching)
- Element 3: ["Ready to Go" Platform](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/readiness/readiness-ready-to-go?tabs=learning)

If you want to have more in depth learning resources to get up to speed, then you can get a sneak-peek of the extensive set of **"Ready to Go" resources available in the online learning catalog**. We highly recommend that you either consume the materials which are built for you in the "Ready to Go" online learning catalog or get coached by one of our ISV Development Centers.

Learn more about how you can leverage the "Ready to Go" program's different support options here: [aka.ms/ReadyToGo](https://aka.ms/readytogo).
