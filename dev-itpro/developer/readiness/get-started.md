# Get Started with Building Apps

[!INCLUDE [prod_long](../includes/prod_long.md)] is a business management solution that helps companies connect their services and operations to streamline business processes, improve customer interactions and make better decisions. With this modern business platform, you've the convenience to quickly tailor, extend, and build applications so that they fit your specific needs with little to no code development.

Build a business app for a specific industry, process, or department such as HR, finance, marketing or operations. Then, publish your app to [the Microsoft commercial marketplace](https://appsource.microsoft.com/partners), where customers can find your app, try it and get in touch with you. For more information, see [What is the Microsoft commercial marketplace?](/azure/marketplace/overview).  

Learn how you can become a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] app publisher in six steps in this article.  

## Step 1: Become a partner

When you become a Microsoft partner, you get access to the Microsoft resources needed to build, market, and sell your apps. You don't have to be a Microsoft partner to begin developing your apps. But, all of the steps below are required to gain access to the programs that enable you to publish, market, and sell your apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].

### Obtain your work account

Your work account is the email address provided to you by your company. This email is usually in the format `you@yourcompany.com`. For more information on work accounts, see [Link your work Account](/partner-center/azure-active-directory-tenants-and-partner-center).

[!INCLUDE [admin-partner-mpn](../includes/admin-partner-mpn.md)]

## Step 2: Register as a publisher

The first step to becoming a publisher is to register in Partner Center (PC). PC is where you submit your apps for publication, promote them, and manage your offers. To begin the registration process, you must complete [these steps](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/enrollment/introduction/azureisv). One of our team members will follow up to help you complete your registration. Once registered, you can access PC.

For more information, see [Partner Center Account](/partner-center/partner-center-account-setup).  

### PartnerSource Business Center (PSBC) account

To develop apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], you're required to be known as a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] developer and have a unique development license file with a specific object range.

To obtain an object range for developing a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] app, you must first have access to PartnerSource Business Center (PSBC). You've access to PSBC if you've one of the following agreements:

- [An active Partner Registration Agreement](https://businesscenter.mbs.microsoft.com/#contentdetail/MSDpartneragreem) (PRA)

- [A Registered Solution Program Addendum](https://businesscenter.mbs.microsoft.com/#contentdetail/RegisterSolutionProgram) (RSPA)

The relevant contract can be requested through your local Regional Operations Center (ROC) Contracts and Agreements Team below:

- [mbscon@microsoft.com](mailto:mbscon@microsoft.com) if you're based in Europe, the Middle East, or Africa

- [mbsagree@microsoft.com](mailto:mbsagree@microsoft.com) if you're based in the Americas

- [mbslques@microsoft.com](mailto:mbslques@microsoft.com) if you're based in the Asia Pacific region.

## Step 3: Your unique app specifications

### Requesting an object range

When you develop an app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], you must request access to an object range that holds a certain number of objects for your solution. To avoid overlap between objects used in different solutions, each partner is assigned a number of objects in a unique object range. For example, a partner is assigned the object range 70,001,000 – 70,001,999. The object range gives them 1000 numbered objects that they can use to develop [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] solutions.

Depending on where you'll deploy your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] solution, online or on-premises, you can use different licensing methods and object ranges.  

[!INCLUDE [object-ranges](../includes/object-ranges.md)]

You can request an object range by downloading the object range request form [here](https://businesscenter.mbs.microsoft.com/#contentdetail/RegisterSolutionProgram). After completion, send them to your Regional Operational Center (ROC) for processing:

- [mbscon@microsoft.com](mailto:mbscon@microsoft.com) if you're based in Europe, the Middle East, or Africa

- [mbsagree@microsoft.com](mailto:mbsagree@microsoft.com) if you're based in the Americas

- [mbslques@microsoft.com](mailto:mbslques@microsoft.com) if you're based in the Asia Pacific region.

### Downloading your development license file

After your Regional Operational Center has processed your Agreements and Object Range Request forms, download your company's unique developer license from [PartnerSource Business Center](https://aka.ms/PSBC). Find it in the license key configuration section under the developer tools section.

### Register your unique prefix or suffix

In your extension, the name of each object must contain [a prefix or suffix](../../compliance/apptest-prefix-suffix.md) that is registered for your publisher name. For more information about the use of affixes and the registration process, see [Benefits and Guidelines for using a Prefix or Suffix](../../compliance/apptest-prefix-suffix.md).
 
## Step 4: Getting access to preview bits

Get access to preview builds by joining Microsoft Collaborate.

In Microsoft Collaborate, you get access to a set of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] builds:

- The current major version
- An upcoming major version
- Daily builds

You must have the following prerequisites to register on Microsoft Collaborate:

- Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you've Microsoft 365, then your company most likely has Azure AD.

- Azure AD Global Administrator permission

  > [!NOTE]
  > To find out if your company has an Azure AD account, check with your system administrator.

### Step 4 A: How your Global Administrator must register for Collaborate

Only your company's Global Administrator can start the onboarding to Collaborate. They must register at [https://aka.ms/Collaborate](https://aka.ms/Collaborate), choose the **Get Started** action, and then complete the registration form.  

The administrator can then add the relevant colleagues.

2. Choose the settings :::image type="content" source="../media/settings_icon_small.png" alt-text="Settings icon."::: icon in the top-right corner of the page,  select on account settings, and choose **user management**.

4. You've successfully added your coworkers to Collaborate. Users can now sign in to Microsoft Collaborate using the following link: [aka.ms/Collaborate](https://aka.ms/Collaborate)

### Step 4 B: Getting access to the available builds and engagements

Once you've successfully registered on Microsoft Collaborate, Microsoft must assign you to the right programs and engagements before you can see the preview bits. Contact [Dyn365BEP@microsoft.com](mailto:Dyn365BEP@microsoft.com) and provide them with information about the relevant users. the following table illustrates the type of information that you must submit:

| **Publisher Display Name** | **MPN ID** | **First Name** | **Last Name** | **Work account Email** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Contoso | 12345 | Eugenia | Lopez | Eugenia.Lopez@Contoso.com |
