An assembly named '{0}' could not be found in the assembly probing paths '{1}'.


## Description
The referenced assembly could not be found in the assembly probing paths. You must add the path of the folder containing the assembly to the Al: Assembly Probing Paths setting on the User Settings or Workspace Settings so the compiler can access it.
