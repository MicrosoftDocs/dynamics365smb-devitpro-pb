## Pragma

The `#pragma` directive gives the compiler special instructions for the compilation of the file in which it appears. The `#pragma` directive has a number of actions that can be used with the pragma instructions below, these are `disable`, `restore`, and `enable`.

AL supports the following pragma instructions:

- [Pragma ImplicitWith](devenv-directive-pragma-implicitwith.md)
