# DrillDownPageId Property
Sets the ID of the page to use as a drill-down.

## Applies to
-   Table
-   Page Field

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)
## Syntax

```AL
DrillDownPageID = 50100;
```

## Remarks  

Drill-downs are a system-wide feature of fields (normal fields and [FlowFields](../devenv-flowfields.md)) that let you see the underlying transactions that make up the information shown in the field. For example, the DrillDownID property is typically used to create a link from a Cue to an underlying page.
