# Creating Handler Methods

You can create test codeunits, test methods, and test pages to test your application. We recommend that you create tests that can be automated. To create automated tests, you must write code to handle all UI interactions so that the tests do not require user interaction when they are running. To do this, you create special handler methods. 
  
You can use the following handler methods:

|Method type|Purpose|  
|-------------------|-------------|  
|MessageHandler|Handles **Message** statements.|  
|ConfirmHandler|Handles **Confirm** statements.|  
|StrMenuHandler|Handles **StrMenu** statements.|  
|PageHandler|Handles specific pages that are not run modally.|  
|ModalPageHandler|Handles specific pages that are run modally.|  
|ReportHandler|Handles specific reports. If you create a **ReportHandler** method, then that method replaces all code for running the report, including the request page, and a **RequestPageHandler** is not called. Only create a **RequestPageHandler** if you are not using a ReportHandler.|  
|FilterPageBuilder|Handles a specific filter page. The FilterPageHandler tests the UI that is generated by a [FilterPageBuilder Data Type](methods-auto/filterpagebuilder/filterpagebuilder-data-type.md).|
|RequestPageHandler|Handles the request page of a specific report.|  
|HyperlinkHandler|Handles specific hyperlinks.|  
|SendNotificationHandler|Handles **Send** statements.|  
|RecallNotificationHandler|Handles **Recall**
|SessionSettingsHandler|Handles **RequestSessionUpdate** statements.| 

  
## How to create a handler method  

To create a handler method, you set one of the handler attributes on a method. You must use the method signature specified for the handler attribute that you are using, as illustrated in this code example.

```
[MessageHandler]
procedure MessageHandler(Message: Text[1024])
begin
    Assert.IsTrue(StrPos(Message, MSG_HAS_BEEN_CREATED) > 0, Message);
end;
```

The parameters of the methods that are being handled are passed as parameters to the handler methods. For example, when **Message** is called in a test method, the parameter of the **Message** method is passed as the parameter of the **MessageHandler** method. For page and report handlers, the page, report, or request page is passed as the parameter of the **PageHandler**, **ModalPageHandler**, **ReportHandler**, or **RequestPageHandler**.

You can call handler methods from methods that have the [Test Attribute](methods/devenv-test-attribute.md) and then specify the handler methods that it will use in the [HandlerFunctions Attribute](methods/devenv-handlerfunctions-attribute.md). The code inside the test method should simulate that the UI was actually raised and some values entered or some actions were taken. You can specify more than one handler method by separating the handler method names with a comma. 

> [!NOTE]
> Every handler method that you enter in the [HandlerFunctions Attribute](methods/devenv-handlerfunctions-attribute.md) of a test method must be called at least one time in the test method. If you run a test method that has a handler method listed that is not called, then the test fails.

The following example shows a test method that uses the [HandlerFunctions Attribute](methods/devenv-handlerfunctions-attribute.md) to call the **MessageHandler** method.

```
[Test]
[HandlerFunctions('MessageHandler')]
procedure ApproveRequestForPurchCreditMemo()
var
    PurchHeader: Record "Purchase Header";
begin
    ApproveRequestForPurchDocument(PurchHeader."Document Type"::"Credit Memo");
end;
```
