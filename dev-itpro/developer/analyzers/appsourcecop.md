# AppSourceCop Analyzer Rules
AppSourceCop is an analyzer that enforces rules that must be respected by extensions meant to be published to Microsoft AppSource.

> Several rules enforced by the AppSourceCop analyzer are incompatible with rules enforced by the PerTenantExtensionCop. Make sure to enable only one of these at a time.

> [!NOTE]  
> Failing to comply with the rules whose default severity is set to `Error` will fail the submission of your extension to the AppSource marketplace. It is recommended, but not mandatory to comply with the rules whose severity is marked as `Warning` or `Info`. 

## Configuration
    
The AppSourceCop analyzer can be further configured by adding a file named `AppSourceCop.json` in the project's root folder. The AL Language extension will offer IntelliSense for this file.

The following table describes the settings in the `AppSourceCop.json` file:

|Setting|Mandatory|Value|
|-------|---------|-----|
|name|No|The name of a previous version of this package with which you want to compare the current package for breaking changes.|
|publisher|No|The publisher of a previous version of this package with which you want to compare the current package for breaking changes.|
|version|Yes|The version of a previous version of this package with which you want to compare the current package for breaking changes.|
|mandatoryAffixes|No|Affixes that must be prepended or appended to the name of all new application objects, extension objects, and fields.|
|supportedCountries|No|The set of country codes, in the alpha-2 ISO 3166 format, in which the application will be available.|
|targetVersion|No|Specifies the next Major.Minor version of the extension in the current branch in order to validate the ObsoleteTag values with AS0072. This is only relevant when the default obsoleteTagPattern '(\\d+)\\.(\\d+)' is used. This property is being deprecated in favor of obsoleteTagVersion.|
|obsoleteTagVersion|No|Specifies the next Major.Minor version of the extension in the current branch in order to validate the ObsoleteTag values with AS0072. This is only relevant when the default obsoleteTagPattern '(\\d+)\\.(\\d+)' is used.|
|obsoleteTagPattern|No|The Obsolete tag pattern used by AS0076. This should be a valid regular expression. By default, the pattern '(\\d+)\\.(\\d+)' is used.|
|obsoleteTagPatternDescription|No|A human-readable description for the ObsoleteTagPattern regular expression. This is used in diagnostics reported by AS0076. By default, 'Major.Minor' is used.|

The `name`, `publisher`, `version` properties are used for specifying a previous version of the current package. This package must be located in the package cache folder of your extension. The `al.packageCachePath` setting allows you to specify the path to a folder that will act as the cache for the symbol files used by your project. AppSourceCop will compare the previous version of your extension with its current version and will report any breaking changes introduced by the current package.

The `mandatoryAffixes` property specifies strings that must be prepended or appended to the names of all new objects, extension objects and fields. By using these affixes, you can prevent clashes between objects added by your extension and objects added by other extensions.

The `supportedCountries` property specifies the codes that correspond to the countries for which the product allows AppSource submissions. For more information, see [Availability and supported Countries/Regions and Translations](../../compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations.md)

## Example
In the following example, we will configure AppSourceCop to validate that all new elements have a name that contains one of the specified affixes.

> [!NOTE]  
> Make sure that code analysis is enabled and `${AppSourceCop}` is specified in the list of enabled code analyzers. For more information see [AL Language Extension Configuration](../devenv-al-extension-configuration.md).

We start by creating the default "Hello world" extension.
```AL
pageextension 50100 CustomerListExt extends "Customer List"
{
    trigger OnOpenPage();
    begin
        begin
            Message('App published: Hello world');
        end;
    end;
}
```

We continue by adding the configuration file `AppSourceCop.json` in the project's root folder and setting its content to the following. 

```json
{
    "mandatoryAffixes": [ "Foo", "Bar" ]
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you are running a multi-root workspace environment, you must have one `AppSourceCop.json` file in the root folder of each of the projects. For more information, see [Working with multiple AL project folders within one workspace](../devenv-multiroot-workspaces.md).


You are immediately greeted by the following error message:
```
AS0011: The identifier 'CustomerListExt' must have at least one of the mandatory affixes 'Foo, Bar'.
```

Prepending **Foo** to the name of the page extension object will fix this error and prevent clashes between this page extension and page extensions added by other developers.

> [!NOTE]  
> It is still possible to use the `mandatoryPrefix` and `mandatorySuffix` properties in the `AppSourceCop.json`. For more information see [AS0011](appsourcecop-as0011-identifiersmusthaveaffix.md).
