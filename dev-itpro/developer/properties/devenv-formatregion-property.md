# FormatRegion Property
> **Version**: _Available or changed with runtime version 11.0._

Sets the format region that will be used when formatting numbers and date/time values.
    
The format for the FormatRegion is based on RFC 4646 is languagecode2-country/regioncode2, where languagecode2 is the two-letter language code and country/regioncode2 is the two-letter subculture code. Examples include ja-JP for Japanese (Japan) and en-US for English (United States).
In cases where a two-letter language code is not available, a three-letter code as defined in ISO 639-3 is used.
