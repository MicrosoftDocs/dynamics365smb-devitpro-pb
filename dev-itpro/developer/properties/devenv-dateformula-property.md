## Remarks  

> [!NOTE]  
>  We recommend that you do not use this property. Use the [DateFormula Data Type](../methods-auto/dateformula/dateformula-data-type.md) instead.  

For fields, this property only applies to text fields. In earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)], the property also applied to code fields, but this has been deprecated.
