## Remarks

Developers can define inherent entitlements for their objects like codeunit, table, page, and so on. In this way, the developers equip all users to have enough access that they can carry out essential tasks without any halt. And regardless of what access their present license or entitlement grant them. For more information, see [Inherent Permissions](../devenv-inherent-permissions.md).
