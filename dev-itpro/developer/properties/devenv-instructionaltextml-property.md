# InstructionalTextML Property
Sets the multilanguage value of the InstructionalText of the object. Use this property as a label.  

> [!NOTE] 
> The support for using the ML properties, such as **CaptionML** and **TooltipML**, is being deprecated, so it is recommended to refactor your extension to use the corresponding **Caption** or **Tooltip** property, which is being picked up in the .xliff file. For more information, see [Working with Translation Files](../devenv-work-with-translation-files.md).
