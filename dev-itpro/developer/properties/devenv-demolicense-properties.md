# Demonstration License for Business Central On-Premises

The demo license is automatically installed when you install the **Demo Option**. The license gives access to any [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] application, including the Base Application, and full access to app development.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The demo license is meant for exploring [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] or developing apps.
>
> Do not use the demo license for production environments.

## Properties of the demo license

When the demo license is installed, you can:  
  
* Start ten simultaneous client sessions on any platform.  
* Create up to two companies.  
* Support an unlimited number of web users.  
* Run in any supported language.
* Use all application functionality, including add-on products, local extensions and customizations in current and previous versions. This means that you can run and modify all object types within the range 1 to 99,999,999.  
  
## Limitations of the demo license

The demo license doesn't let you enter dates in months other than November, December, January, and February in any [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] clients.
