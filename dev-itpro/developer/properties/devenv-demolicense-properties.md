# Demonstration License for Business Central On-Premises

The demo license is automatically installed when you install the **Demo Option**. The demo license works with the [!INCLUDE[demolong](../includes/demolong_md.md)], has serial number 000, and includes granule 540. The license allows access to the entire base application and limited access to the development system.

- Start up to two simultaneous client sessions on any platform.  
- Create up to two companies.  
- Support an unlimited number of web users.  
- Run in any supported language. 
- Use all application functionality, including add-on products, local extensions and customizations in current and previous versions. This means that you can run, but not modify, all object types within the range 1 to 99,999,999.  
- Run and modify table 18, pages 21 and 22, report 101, and XMLports 99,008,503 and 99,008,510.
