# Scope Property
Specifies the scope of the action to be either page-specific, or specific to a repeater control. The **Scope** property has two options; **Page** and **Repeater**.  
  
 The **Scope** property is only used on pages that include a repeater control and it offers a way to determine the scope of an action to be the page or to be specific to the repeater control. The default behavior of the **Scope** property is **Page**.
