# Width Property
Sets the width of the control. Width is set as a number of characters and must be a fixed number when specified.  
  
## Applies To  
  
-   Page Fields  
  
-   Table Fields  
  
## Remarks  
 For controls, the width specifies the width of the column. Static controls in the heading inherit the width from the column control.  
  
 For example, use the **Width** property to set decimals so that they do not take up too much space in a grid.  
  
<!-- For controls on the [!INCLUDE[rtc](includes/rtc_md.md)] you always have the option of resizing column width in the UI, but when running the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] the **Width** property can be set to a fixed number to increase readability. -->
