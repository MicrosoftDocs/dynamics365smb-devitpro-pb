# OCX Data Type
References a custom control, such as OCX or ActiveX control.  
  
## Remarks  
<!--  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  OCX data types are not supported by [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)].  
  
 To use a control in [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)], define a variable of type OCX and give it a name. Then choose the lookup button in the **Subtype** field to locate and select the control that you want to use. You select from a list of installed controls, and when you select one, the GUID of the control is inserted. When the focus leaves the **Subtype** field, the name of the control is substituted for the GUID.  
  
 When you have defined a control as a variable, you can use the control through the variable, and you can browse its methods and properties in the Symbol Menu.  
  
 When you are using a control, there is no one-to-one relationship between AL data types and COM data types. For an overview of the data type mapping, see [Using COM Technologies in Microsoft Dynamics NAV](Using-COM-Technologies-in-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV.md).-->
