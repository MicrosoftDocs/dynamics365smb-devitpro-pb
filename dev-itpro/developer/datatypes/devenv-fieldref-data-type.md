# FieldRef Data Type
This complex data type identifies a field in a table and gives you access to this field. The FieldRef object can refer to any field in any table in the database.  
  
## Methods
The methods supported for the FieldRef data type are:

[ACTIVE method (FieldRef)](../methods/devenv-active-method-fieldref.md)   
[CALCFIELD method (FieldRef)](../methods/devenv-calcfield-method-fieldref.md)   
[CALCSUM method (FieldRef)](../methods/devenv-calcsum-method-fieldref.md)   
[CAPTION method (FieldRef, TestPage Field)](../methods/devenv-caption-method-fieldref-testpage-field.md)   
[CLASS method (FieldRef)](../methods/devenv-class-method-fieldref.md)
