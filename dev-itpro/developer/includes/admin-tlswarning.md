> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting March, 2020, Business Central only supports Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.2 or later. This applies to Business Central 2019 release wave 2 online and on-premises (version 15.x). Upgrade to Business Central 2019 release wave 2 or later to remove support for earlier versions of TLS. If your solution or an add-on uses TLS 1.0 or 1.1, you must update that configuration or add-on to TLS 1.2 or later as soon as possible. For more information, see [Blog post: Update to TLS 1.2 or later in Dynamics 365 Business Central in 2019 release wave 2](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/it/2019/08/29/update-tls-1-2-dynamics-365-business-central-2019-release-wave-2/).
