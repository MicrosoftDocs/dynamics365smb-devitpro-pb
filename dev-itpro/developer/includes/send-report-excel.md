> [!TIP]
> From the Business Central client, you can export report results as raw data to a Microsoft Excel file. The file contains all columns of the dataset, but without the layout applied. Use the file to help validate that the report returns the expected data, and to ensure that the report layout controls match the dataset value types. To export a report, run the report and select the **Send to** > **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)**  on the request page. For more information, see [Working with Reports - Send to Excel](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-work-report#send-to-excel).
