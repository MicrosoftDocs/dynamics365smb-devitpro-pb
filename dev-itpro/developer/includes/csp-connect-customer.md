As a CSP partner, you can  manage a customer's subscriptions and services on their behalf in the Partner Center by establishing a reseller relationship with your customers. If they already have an account, such as if they currently use Microsoft 365, other Dynamics 365 apps, or PowerApps, for example, you can send them an invitation straight from the Partner Center. For more information, see [Connect with customers in Partner Center (indirect providers/distributors)](/partner-center/request-a-relationship-with-a-customer) and [Connect with customers (indirect resellers)](/partner-center/indirect-reseller-tasks-in-partner-center#connect-with-customers).  

When the customer's internal administrator receives the invitation link and navigates to it, they must acknowledge that they have read the Microsoft Customer Agreement and that they can authorize you as their reseller on behalf of their organization. For more information, see [Confirm customer acceptance of the Microsoft Customer Agreement](/partner-center/confirm-customer-agreement).  

In addition to a reseller relationship, partners may want to set up a GDAP relationship to access and administer the customer's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] environments. For more information, see [Delegated Administrator Access to Business Central Online](../../administration/delegated-admin.md).

If you are working as an indirect reseller, your indirect provider (distributor) must [associate your customers with you in their Partner Center](/partner-center/indirect-provider-tasks-in-partner-center#add-new-customers-and-associate-them-with-indirect-resellers).
