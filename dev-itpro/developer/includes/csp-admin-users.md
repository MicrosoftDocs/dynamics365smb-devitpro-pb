In the Microsoft Partner Center documentation, you can learn how to [request a reseller relationship with customers](/partner-center/request-a-relationship-with-a-customer), [assign licenses to users](/partner-center/assign-licenses-to-users), and [create new subscriptions](/partner-center/create-a-new-subscription). [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] is one of the subscriptions that you can create.  

### Add users from your own organization

Typically, a partner organization includes employees with different responsibilities. You can assign different roles to users in your Partner Center environment depending on their responsibilities. Learn more in [Roles, permissions, and workspace access for users](/partner-center/account-settings/permissions-overview).

Employees in your partner organization can access [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] environments in your customers' tenants if they are a member of a security group that is assigned an Entra role that allows for administration and access of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] in a *granular delegated administration privileges (GDAP)* relationship set up with the customer. These partner users in a customer tenant are called *delegated administrators* in daily shorthand. For more information, see [Delegated Administrator Access to Business Central Online](../../administration/delegated-admin.md).  

> [!NOTE]
> Delegated administrators cannot provide accounting services for the customers. For this purpose, the customers must use the **External Accountant** license, which is also available via CSP.
