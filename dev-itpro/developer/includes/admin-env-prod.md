Production environments are meant to be precisely that: Environments that a business can run their daily business in [!INCLUDE [prodshort](prodshort.md)] in, deployed on performance tiers in Azure with a guaranteed high level of availability and support.  

Production environments are backed up automatically and frequently to help protect business data. For more information, see [How often are production databases backed up?](../../faq.md#how-often-are-production-databases-backed-up).  

You can create additional production environments for training or performance testing, for example. However, for training purposes, in many cases organizations will prefer to create a sandbox environment with production data. You can also create additional production environments to support offices in different countries.
