When a trial or a subscription expires, two special periods kick in: 

- *Grace period*
- *Data retention period*

The *grace period* is a period of 30 days when the customer can still access the product without any restrictions. After the grace period, the subscription enters the *data retention period*, which is another 90 days during which only the admin users of the Azure Active Directory tenant can login into the product. After those 90 days, Microsoft deletes the data automatically.  

This policy is general across Microsoft's online offerings, as you can see in this example from Microsoft 365: [What happens to my data and access when my Microsoft 365 for business subscription ends?](/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/what-if-my-subscription-expires?view=o365-worldwide).
