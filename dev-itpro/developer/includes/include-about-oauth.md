OAuth is an open standard for authorizing access to web services and APIs from native clients and websites in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)], OAuth is useful when your deployment is configured for Azure Active Directory authentication, either through your own Azure subscription or a Microsoft 365 subscription. OAuth lets users sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] web services using their Microsoft 365 or Azure AD credentials. Otherwise, they would have to use their [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] account credentials (user name and password or web access key).
