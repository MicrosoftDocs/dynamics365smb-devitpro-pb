An organization can sign up for a free trial of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)]. When they first sign up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)], they get access to an evaluation version that does not include all capabilities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)]. They can then switch to the 30 day trial experience to enable all capabilities.  

However, sometimes a 30 day trial is not enough to decide if they want to buy [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)]. In that case, they can extend their trial with an additional 30 days. For more information, see [Need More Time to Decide Whether to Subscribe?](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-extend-trial) in the business functionality content for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)].  

> [!NOTE]
> If you are a reselling partner, we recommend that you set up demo environments for prospects that need longer time to decide if they want to buy [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)]. You can also use demo environments to help customers train their employees, for example. Using the 30 days trials for training should be limited to just that short period. However, demo environments cannot be used for production. For more information, see [Preparing Demonstration Environments](../../administration/demo-environment.md).

If the prospect wants to extend the trial further than those 30 days, they must contact a [partner](/dynamics365/business-central/across-faq#findpartner). The partner can extend it another 30 days if the delegated administrator signs into the prospect's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] and runs the **Extend Trial Period** guide.  

After those additional 30 days, the prospect must either purchase [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] or abandon [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)]. At this point, they will have had up to 90 days with the trial experience.  

> [!TIP]
> As a reselling partner, you can suggest your prospects sign up for a trial, but you can also help set up a customized demonstration environment based on a sandbox environment or a trial environment. In both cases, you can easily add or remove functionality based on your prospects' expectations. For more information, see [Preparing Demonstration Environments](../../administration/demo-environment.md).
