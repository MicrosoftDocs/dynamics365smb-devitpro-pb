Collect telemetry data in Microsoft Azure Application Insights. When you submit an app to AppSource, it starts an automated validation process. This process ensures the extensions in the app meet the technical requirements for going live. It goes through many of the same checks described in [technical validation](https://aka.ms/CheckBeforeYouSubmit). Starting with version 18.4, if an app's set up for it, telemetry traces for the app submission can be emitted to and recorded in Application Insights. The data provides immediate details about the success or failure of different phases of the validation. For more information, see [Sending Extension Telemetry to Azure Application Insights](../devenv-application-insights-for-extensions.md) and [Analyzing AppSource Submission Validation Trace Telemetry](../../administration/telemetry-appsource-submission-validation-trace.md).
