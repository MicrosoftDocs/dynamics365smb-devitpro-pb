Because you are logged in as the global administrator of the demonstration tenant, you can access the Microsoft 365 administration center. The following list illustrates the types of work that your demo account can do:

* Subscribe to additional apps and services that may be relevant to your demos  

* Configure apps and services by accessing their administration centers  

* Modify or add user accounts, and assign licenses  

* Set up the organizational profile to reflect your prospect's business and brand  

Your administrator account also gives you access to the [!INCLUDE [prodshort](prodshort.md)] administration center, where you can make further customizations, such as the following:

* Create additional [environments](../../administration/tenant-admin-center-environments.md) within the available quota, depending on your needs.  

    For example, you can create a [!INCLUDE [prodshort](prodshort.md)] environment for a specific country/region, or create a dedicated sandbox that you then apply your solution to, such as by deploying your app straight from Visual Studio Code. For more information, see [Managing Environments](../../administration/tenant-admin-center-environments.md).  

* Specify the [update window and date for your environments](../../administration/tenant-admin-center-update-management.md), so that planned updates will not interfere with your demos.  

* Add your own email address to the list of [notification recipients](../../administration/tenant-admin-center-notifications.md), so that you will be informed of upgrades to your [!INCLUDE [prodshort](prodshort.md)] environments or any issues that may impact your planned demos.

* Try out new functionality in preview environments that are available about two months before a major update. For more information, see [Prepare for major updates with preview environments](../../administration/preview-environments.md).  

With your administrator account, you can install apps from AppSource, and you can set up integrations between [!INCLUDE [prodshort](prodshort.md)] and other services. For example, you can add the [!INCLUDE [prodshort](prodshort.md)] app for Microsoft Teams, and you can run the **Set up your Business Inbox in Outlook** assisted setup guide on behalf of the organization. For more information, see [Using [!INCLUDE [prodshort](prodshort.md)] as your Business Inbox in Outlook](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-outlook). You can also add [Dynamics 365 Customer Service](/dynamics365/customer-service/index), [Dynamics 365 Sales](/dynamics365/sales-enterprise/overview), [Power Automate](/power-automate/), [Power Apps](/powerapps/), and many more.  

Some content packs provide additional demonstration data for non-administrator accounts, such as example channels and conversations in Microsoft Teams that can reduce the time needed to customize the experience for a demo. You can log in with the demo user account, often called `meganb@M365B123456.onmicrosoft.com`, or something similar, for the non-administrator experience.
