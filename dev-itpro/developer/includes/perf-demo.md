If you want to provide a prospect with an online environment where you want to demonstrate the performance and reliability of [!INCLUDE [prodshort](prodshort.md)] online in addition to demonstrating functionality, you must take a few extra steps.  

To demonstrate the functionality of the default version of [!INCLUDE [prodshort](prodshort.md)], without focusing on performance, you can quite simply use your own trial experience based on a Microsoft 365 demo account. We recommend that you show the full functionality of the default version by switching the tenant to the 30 day trial and the associated My Company. You can then enable the *Premium* user experience in the new My Company's **Company Information** page, populate the new company with the data required for their evaluation scenarios, and present the environment to the prospect. For more information, see [Your own trial](../../administration/demo-environment.md#your-own-trial).  

To demonstrate the functionality of the service, with a focus on performance, you can take the same step as outlined above, but then also sign up the prospect for the [!INCLUDE [prodshort](prodshort.md)] Premium Trial offer that is available through your CSP access in the Partner Center, wait 24 hours, and then run your performance evaluation. For more information, see [Preparing Test Environments of [!INCLUDE[prodlong](prodlong.md)]](../../administration/test-environment.md).  

That 30 day trial is as close to an actual production environment performance as you can get. You only have those 29 days to run your tests and convince the prospect, of course, but provided that you have prepared everything in advance, it should give you time enough.  

If the prospect is convinced and decides to buy [!INCLUDE [prodshort](prodshort.md)], you can then either let them keep the environment that they are currently using, or create a new production environment for them. If the tenant is yours rather than the prospect's, then a new tenant will be provided to them.
