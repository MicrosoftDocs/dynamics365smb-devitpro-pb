> Internet browsers can only handle one file per request. Therefore, with the Web client, if this method is called in a repetitive statement (or loop) that generates multiple files, only the last file will be sent to the browser. Alternatively, when designing for the Web client, bundle the files in an archive file (.zip), for example, by using the methods found in codeunit **419 File Management**. For more details about this design pattern, see [Multi-File Download](https://community.dynamics.com/nav/w/designpatterns/220.multi-file-download). The methods in codeunit 419 are not external, therefore cannot be used in extensions. Instead, when developing extensions in AL, use the external methods of codeunit **425 Data Compression**. The approach is similar.
